# Retrieve Leather Bundle for Bill Draur

COMPLETE

In [[Session 04#Visiting Bill Draur's Mercantile]], [[Bildrath]] requested we head to the bridge over the river near [[Barovia Village]] to retrieve his leather bundle

- Leather bundle should have identifying marks
- Bill indicated that there may be danger involved
- Said we could have a 20% discount to [[Bildrath's Mercantile]] if we acquire the goods

## Progress

In [[Session 05]] we had a [[Session 05#Battle for the Leather Bundle]] and acquired it.  [[Sanar]] convinced [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] to open the bundle to find 4 explorers packs. Sealing it back up, we returned it to [[Bildrath]] who screwed us over anyway.
