The Storm of Ash was the bloody invasion of Silverymoon that took place during Kythorn, 1490 D.R. This battle was foreshadowed by the East and West being blocked off by both the Zhentarim and Bloodswords. This included trade being cut off by the coast and Zhentarim sightings becoming more and more common in Sundabar. Ultimately, the attack invoked fear against the Drow, and all across Faerun, propaganda was propagated against them. This heightened fear pushed Silverymoon, and other countries, to take action against Drow cities in the Underdark. Though the war hasn’t been long, the casualties have been high, and the pain still lingers. 

## Chronology

### Warning Signs

Though the invasion was sudden, there were many warning signs that signaled an incoming attack. One of the first signs that a planned attack was about to occur was the expansion of enemy groups on all sides. The Bloodswords, a group of thieves and bandits, cut off trade caravans from going to the coast. This stopped Silverymoon from making profits off of their magical wares and spells. In addition, the Zhentarim, a prominent ally of the Bloodswords, expanded its reach in all directions. There were reported sightings as far north as the Ten Towns and as far east as Sundabar. The second sign was an increase in the Drow population throughout the year. Silverymoon received a significant influx of Drow the year of the attack. Even the local Moonmistress, Phyrra Helfina, predicted this event during her Moon Reading the morning before, “I sense something. A predator hiding from the prey. The prey is surrounded but knows not.” Reports say she was very troubled by this telling, and she cut the session early. 

### Storm of Ash 

The Storm of Ash was a magical storm created by Caelynn Hlaund, a powerful Cleric of Lolth, to protect the Drow from the sun. Once captured, Hlaund revealed this spell was inspired by a “devil up north.” Many have speculated this to be related to Auril’s Everlasting Rime in Icewind Dale. This powerful spell made being above the surface even possible for the Drow during the attack, and it managed to bypass the Mythal. It laid a thick coat of ash on the streets of Silverymoon and made it hard for civilians and soldiers to run throughout the streets. Stories from the event say attackers easily slid through it like water and were unimpeded by the ash. 

### Betrayal 

Another defining turning point in this invasion was the betrayal of Jaeger Wolfgang. Wolfgang was an old member of the Lunae Lumen, a group of adventurers that specialize in collecting powerful magic items, and he often clashed with other members of his group. From testimonies of his ex-Lunae Lumen, “Jaeger always wanted to ‘go back to the old days.’” Ever since Lunae Lumen focused their works in Silverymoon, Jaeger has wanted to pursue his greed elsewhere. He struck a deal with the Zhentarim, and with his access to politicians, located the Mythal, and handed it over to the Zhentarim. Taking the Mythal from its home deactivated the shield around Silverymoon, and allowed the Drow to enter. 

### Targets 

The main objective of the invasion was not to take over Silverymoon. Instead, it was to obtain the Mythal and possibly take over Silverymoon. Therefore, soldiers were instructed to target popular landmarks and places of significance in order to stretch out the forces. The first of these landmarks to go was the Silverglen. A massive tree once stood in the place of worship but was burned down once they attacked. Other significant places of worship were destroyed at the beginning of the invasion. Once important places were destroyed, soldiers were commanded to specifically attack civilians. Some believe this was to either weaken the stability of the city if they were to overtake it or weaken the morale of the remaining soldiers. Either way, this tactic pulled the remaining soldiers away from the castle and allowed Drow to set up fortifications around it. Fortifying the castle made the Drow have a strong defense against soldiers if they were to try and take it back. 

### Infiltration of Castle Silvermoon 

From the recounting of the Lunae Lumen, the most pivotal point of the invasion was their infiltration of Castle Silvermoon. Once the Drow had secured their station at Castle Silvermoon, their only weakness was the backdoor they came through. That backdoor being the newly created sewers under the city. As the group snuck through the castle, killing patrolling Drow, they claimed to have found the throne room of High Mage Methrammar Aerasumé. Behind the throne was an apparent portal to a demi-plane. Although the chances are unlikely, the Lunae Lumen claims to have traveled to Selûne (the moon of Toril) due to the change of gravity and a view of Toril from space. What ensued in the demi-plane is purely speculation, and there are no other witnesses except for the Lunae Lumen. According to the group, there was a large ruined building of stone in the plane. Iconography of the moon and gods were inscribed into stone, and a large symbol of Selûne was carved on the floor of the temple. After investigating for some time, the group was attacked by a being made of several revolving rings and a fetus at the center of the rings. Stabbed through the center of the fetus was the Mythal. After a gruesome battle with the creature, Lunae Lumen retrieved the Mythal and returned to Silverymoon.

### Aftermath 

After the Mythal was recovered, most of the Drow began to flee the city. With their mission failed and supposed leader dead, they had no reason to stay. Many of the Drow were captured while fleeing, and many of the POWs were publicly executed or used to gather information. Eventually, wizards and workers from all over Faerun came to help rebuild the broken city. But, these sins are not so easily forgiven. With the support of other cities over the Silver Marches, Silverymoon marched into the Underdark to attempt to fight against the encroaching Drow. This war is, by all means, not new. Thousands of these skirmishes have happened before. But with the amount of death from this previous attack, a wave of new anger is brewing within the people of Silverymoon.
