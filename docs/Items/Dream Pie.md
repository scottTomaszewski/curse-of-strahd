# Dream Pie

[[Morgantha]] sells pies made by [[Bella]] and [[Ophalia]] that seem to "uplift one's spirits."  In [[Session 07#Discovering the Windmill of Morgantha]], [[Bella]] said that she is "happy that people appreciate their work: to make people in [[Barovia]] happy."

## Effects 

- Beautiful, restful sleep
	- As seen in [[Session 04]] after [[Kali Rouge|Kali]], [[Nox Vita|Nox]], and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] ate some pie when [[Session 04#Entering Barovia Village]] then took a [[Session 04#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor]]

The next day, a consumer craves the pie and need to make a CON saving throw to beat the temptation.  On a failure, the consumer has Disadvantage until they eat more pie.
