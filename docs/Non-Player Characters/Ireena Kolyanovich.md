## History

### Strahd Makes Moves

- [[Strahd von Zarovich]] has affection for Ireena according to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]; and the village knows
- Strahd bit her twice "recently"
	- She is not showing signs of change, we know there are other parts of the ritual that need to take place in order to complete the transformation
	- She is unsure why she was bitten 
	- Ireena described Strahd's eyes as "hypnotic"
		- He was very polite
		- She could not say "no" (she was charmed)
		- She let him into her house both times	as he is forbidden (see [[Strahd von Zarovich#Forbidden Entry]])
	- The [[Lord Rahadin]] was with Strahd in a Black Carriage
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] was also with them, but he too was charmed and unable to stop Strahd
		- Said he "didn't want to" in the moment
