## Encounters

- In a dream during [[Session 4#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor]] she wore a Dark Purple Cloak and drew the "Mist" card from a [[Tarokka Deck]]
	- `Mists card (part of the high deck) represents Something unexpected or mysterious that can’t be avoided; a great quest or journey that will try one’s spirit` according to Matt.
