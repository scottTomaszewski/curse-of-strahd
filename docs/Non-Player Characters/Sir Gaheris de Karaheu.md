# Sir Gaheris de Karaheu

A Zombie-like creature wearing leather armor, wielding a Longsword, and had eyes that were vibrant with life, unlike a traditional Zombie.  In [[Session 6#Wolf Ambush]], he introduced himself and claimed to be part of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]].  When asked by [[Nox Vita|Nox]] how he is "undead, but not dead" he responded, "Vengeance keeps me alive."
