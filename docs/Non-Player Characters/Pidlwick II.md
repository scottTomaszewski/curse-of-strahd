> Official:   
> A clockwork oversized toy—a 4-foot-tall mechanism stuffed with gears, springs, and other components expertly fitted together to impart a semblance of life to it.

Pidlwick II has rubbed soot around its eyes and mouth, giving it the triangular eyes and jagged grin of a jack-o’-lantern.

> Piddlewick said he was made by a man named Fritz Von Weirg. Blinksy the toymaker said he admired Fritz, and Piddlewick was one of Fritz's legendary creations, but Blinsky said Fritz is long dead
