# Ravens

They're ravens.

When we nearly passed one in [[Session 04#Entering Barovia Village]] we saw others placing two fingers over their heart as they passed the ravens.  In [[Session 06#Walking to the Tser Pool]], [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] informed us that Ravens represent good luck and to kill one would incur bad luck.  The origins of this correlation is unknown, its passed down as tradition, but it may be rooted in the [[Mother Night]].  When asked why the people hide it, Ireena said that recognition of the raven may be seen as treasonous against [[Strahd von Zarovich]].
