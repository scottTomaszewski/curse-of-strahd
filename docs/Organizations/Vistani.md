### Relationship with Strahd

In [[Session 4#Evening in the Burgomaster Manor]], [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] expressed that he believes that the Vistani and [[Strahd von Zarovich]] are in collaboration.  However, in [[Session 6#Tser Pool Vistani Encampment]], [[Stanamir]] clarifies that the Vistani are not Strahd's servants - they simply have a "mutual respect" for each other, but [[Stanamir]] is not surprised that people think they are allies.  

[[Stanamir]] also claimed in [[Session 6#Tser Pool Vistani Encampment]] that it was the Vistani that nursed Strahd back to health long ago and that was the reason for the mutual respect - that so long as they don't break his rules, the Vistani are free to come and go as necessary.
