# Vampirism 

## Lore

- Has to sleep in a coffin
- Can turn into bat or wolf
- Fear of running water
- Stake when in resting spot will kill
- Forbidden Entry
	- According to [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] in [[Session 04#Evening in the Burgomaster Manor]], when she was charmed by Strahd (see [[Ireena Kolyanovich#Strahd Makes Moves]]), rumor has it that he was forbidden from entering a home without permission


## Traits

## Conversion

[[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] shared that his father informed him that there are different rituals to convert an individual into different [[#Types]] of vampires.  A [[#Bite]] is involved, but is only part of the [[#Ritual]] and a bite alone will not convert.

### Bite

You need to get bit, but a bite alone is not sufficient for a transformation.

### Ritual

We know there is a ritual involved (according to [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri's]] father), but unsure of the details

## Types

### Full Vampire 

These individuals show all the traits of vampirism and possess significant power

- [[Strahd von Zarovich]]

### Vampire Wannabe

These individuals show the traits of vampirism, but are not as strong as a [[#Full Vampire]].  [[Doru]] for example, was restrained in the basement of the [[Barovia Church of the Morning Lord|Barovia Church]] unable to escape.

Examples:
- [[Doru]]
- [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]]

### The Bitten

These individuals have been bitten, but have not undergone a [[#Ritual]].  They show no traits other than the bite marks.

Examples:
- [[Ireena Kolyanovich]]

### Dhampir

We learn from [[Stanamir]] in [[Session 07#Speaking with Stanamir]] that Dhampir are half human, half vampire, but not really either.  He implied that being a Dhampir likely requires one be bitten.
