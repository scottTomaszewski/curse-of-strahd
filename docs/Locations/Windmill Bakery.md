# Windmill Bakery

![[Windmill Bakery.png]]

The dwelling place of [[Morgantha]] and her daughters, [[Bella]] and [[Ophalia]]. Within are massive baking equipment and Twig Figurines.

## Four Stone Square

Nearby are four moss/ivy covered stones standing in a rough open square.  Is the remnant of an old building [[Session 7#The Four Stone Square|according to]] [[Bella]].  There is an Altar in the center of the 4 standing stones with another flat stone in front of the altar and we found teeth scattered about the ground.  [[Morgantha]] said it was a dark place of power that required sacrifice.
