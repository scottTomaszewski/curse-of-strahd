# Burgomaster Manor

- Home to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] [[Ireena Kolyanovich]]
	- Previously [[Kolyan Indirovich]] until his death (See [[Ireena Kolyanovich#Nightly Attacks]]])

## Description

When we first arrived at the manor in [[Session 4#Evening in the Burgomaster Manor]], the manor was not looking good

- Claw marks on the walls
- Blood ichor nasty all over the place
- Barred windows
- Weeds trampled by humand and wolf footprints

On the interior, there were Holy Symbols in every room.  There were several rooms for sleeping.
