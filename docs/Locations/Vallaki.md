Guards shared the Vallaki laws with us in [[Session 8#Traveling to the Vallaki Gates]]:

- Mention of the name [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is illegal, even in written form, must refer to him as 'The Devil' or 'He who must not be named'
- Festival each week for the Burgomaster
	- Attendance is required, although we don't have to participate
	- See [[Attend Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
- Morale is paramount: No one should speak poorly of the [[Vallaki Burgomaster]] or the Festival
	- No down-playing anyone
- Normal town laws all apply
- Criminals will be punished according to the justice system
