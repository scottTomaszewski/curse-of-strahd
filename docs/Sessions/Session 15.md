# Session 15

## Raw Notes

![[Vallaki Mob.png]]

### Zach

 - The Festival of the Blazing Sun went south REAL fast. Watchter fueled the mob, calling for the Baron's overthrowing. The mob overwhelmed the Baron's forces, escalating to violence.
- The Baron tried to run, but the mob easily caught up. They hung the Baron and threw the Baroness into the fire. Izek, meanwhile, was able to use the distraction to escape. Though Puff was able to track him all the way to the woods outside the city.
- The bonfire began to spread out of the ball, but Watchter was able to be convinced to shift the mob's chaos to the Reformation Center and the Baron's Mansion rather than destroying the city.
- The party rescued Nox, and was able to put out most of the fires.
- Together, we headed to the Reformation Center, cleared out the lower level jail cells, and retrieve Nox's stuff.
- We made our way back to the church and decided to follow up on the missing alcohol lead while the town settles a bit.
- There's a chance the Father would be interested in helping lead the town - if we can convince Watchter to play nice. We'll need to come back in a few days (hopefully with good news on the alcohol) to try and help the town recover.
- While traveling to the Wizard of Wines, Strahd's right hand man, Lord Rahadin, met us on the road. He officially invited us to dinner at the castle in 6 days. After some cold exchanges, he finally left implying it would be good for us to not miss this dinner.
- We ended on the road, tired but determined to connect with Davian Martikov

	- Puff tires to lift Nox to fly him out of the crowd, but he is way too heavy
	- Nirin cuts the bindings around Nox's wrists
	- Nox picks up Izek's battle-axe and finally notices Nirin's missing leg
	- Sanar tires to determine where Izek is and uses Silent Image to make it look like a wall raises from the ground blocking his path
		- Uses Subtle to ensure the mob doesn't know he did this
	- Ireena uses a bandage to heal up Nox a bit
- Izek runs around the wall to another area of the town and is able to jump a fence to flee

	- Others in the crowd put out the fire or move towards the reformation center

	- He feels guilty for Nirin's lost leg, who is fine w/ it
	- Nox tells Nirin he understands [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s influence now that he is free of it

	- Sanar and Klepto are worried about [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] making a move toward the new Burgomaster and are curious of [[Danica Martikov|Danica]]'s opinion
	- Demetri is curious if [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will appear - [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] doesn't think he cares about [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] or [[Vallaki]], only us
	- She states if we truly want to help her, then figuring out the wine shipment would be the best bet
		- It is one of the few things that give people hope
	- Mob is on their own now, I don't think there is much anyone can do to stop/appease them
		- Klepto isn't sure there is much us outsiders can do with the mob
	- She believes the mob is probably converging on the reformation center and destroying it
		- Klepto mentions it might be worth checking out the reformation center given the rumors [[Klepto]] heard in the bar ([[Session 12#Bluewater Tavern]])
		- [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] mentions the elves at the reformation center have been here for ages, prior to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s father at least
	- Group agrees to head to the Manor/Reformation center, [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] joins

#### Manor and Reformation center

- As we head there we see only about 10% of the city is destroyed
	- Nirin asks [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] about a tinkerer's who could possibly make a mechanical leg, or at least the supplies
		- Doesn't know anyone, but could definitely try to find some supplies
- As we arrive at the Burgomaster's manor we see it is consumed in flames
	- Reformation center is partly on fire, with several dead bodies around it, the doors are knocked over
- Nox tries to run in on his own so no one else has to risk their lives
	- Sanar tells him that there is more than just his stuff there that the group needs to find
	- Nirin and Sanar convince the mob to let us in
- The pack is near the entrance and he looks for everything
	- Immediately finds his box, hugs it, and the dons his weapon and shield
- Klepto doesn't see any bodies that resemble the Elves
- We work our way through main hall of the Reformation center
	- See a few guards trying to hold off a mob of people throwing in Molotov cocktails
	- Approach the door to the basement, it's locked but one of the keys Sanar has opens it
	- We work our way down and approach another door, Klepto tries to hear on the other side but doesn't detect anything
- As soon as we cross over the plane of the door into a corridor noise completely ceases
	- In the middle of the corridor is a pale blue glowing orb
	- 8 heavy iron doors on sides of hallway, with another on the far end of the corridor
	- Nox and Klepto go to open one of the doors
		- Inside the door is a old, scraggly, almost feral man
		- Nox gives him a ration - he immediately grabs it and shoves it in his mouth
		- Nox lets the man leave, and he runs through the corridor and up the stairs
			- Klepto tells Kali to stop the man from leaving
	- Open each door, Nox repeats the previous actions
		- Ask Kali to talk to Danica about who these people are as they leave - they were all villagers, some vagrants others not
- Demetri approaches final door at the hall, it is locked with heavy latches and bolts, with a 2 inch flap at the bottom to pass meals
	- Nirin summons Aba to look through the crack and something immediately goes to grab Aba
	- Demetri opens the latch, we see a hallway going each way and a foul stench of human waste immediately hits us
	- Sanar uses detect thoughts but doesn't sense anything (intelligence less than 3)
	- Group isn't sure what to do
		- Sanar is worried they are too broken and could be dangerous to the rest of the village
		- General consensus though is they don't deserve to die down here
	- Klepto crosses the threshold and sees a pale Gollum-like, man in the open door across the threshold
		- Silence is no longer active as he asks us 'whose there?' - Klepto tells him the Baron is dead and we want to free him
		- Responds that he has stabbed several people and he'll stab more, clearly crazy
			- Sanar is worried about letting them free and them escaping as they are clearly dangerous
			- Klepto doesn't care, they don't deserve to die down here, we should rely on the Baron's opinion of them to guide what to do with them
			- We should take them to the [[Church of Saint Andral]]
		- Nirin uses Aba to try and try and distract the guy and slowly lead him up to Kali
	- We open all of the doors and each room holds a similarly broken-minded individual inside, a few have corpses
		- Nirin prays briefly over the corpses and Zrin-Hala appears
	- Nirin finds a crawl-sized tunnel descending into the darkness in one of the rooms
		- Nirin sends Aba down and it eventually leads him to outside the prison
	- We all leave and encounter [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] when we're out
		- She states some of the people we released were really bad people, others likely just caught [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s ire

#### Taking the prisoners to the [[Church of Saint Andral]]

- Klepto asks if we can use his crypt to hold onto some of the more violent prisoners
	- [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] isn't sure who is violent and who isn't, but they'll do their best to see who is who
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks if he thinks we could revert them back to their previous mental state
		- Sanar says there was nothing left, but would refer to [[Nox Vita|Nox]]'s expertise
		- [[Nox Vita|Nox]] is able to tell that they were subject to the feeblemind spell, but likely to be irreversible within their current powers
- Nox tells [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] that he is sorry about everything that has happened
	- He says it isn't our fault, everything that has happened was already here, even if we were a bit of a catalyst
	- Nox asks if he's heard from the [[Morning Lord]] at all, no one has for quite some time
- Demetri talks to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about the role of the new Burgomaster, or possibly a council of voices
	- Isn't keen to take it, but if it's what the people think is best then he would step into a leadership role
- We speak to [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] about if it is worth leaving the town now to pursue the wine when there is a vacuum of power
	- It's risky, but the people would appreciate the wine, and she can spread word of the idea of a council in the meantime
	- Could possibly even offer [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] a seat at the council, as long as she doesn't have all of the power
	- She warns us that we may hear rumors about [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] while we are there, but they aren't necessarily true
		- A bit of a falling out between [[Davian Martikov]] (Urwin's brother) and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and they aren't on speaking terms right now
	- Decide to leave to the Winery, sooner rather than later, so as not to waste time

#### Heading to the Wizard of Wines Winery

- Guards at the Western gate have been hung
- Demetri is able to tell us that Izek fled the town to the West in the woods
- After about an hour of travel we come across a Black Carriage, the same one that was seen by some of the group at [[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]'s funeral
	- The group tells Sanar and Nirin who the carriage belongs to
	- Sanar immediately gets serious, but knows it would be best to avoid them for now
	- [[Lord Rahadin]] exits with a sword on his hip and an envelope in his hand
		- States he has a friendly invitation from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- As he approaches us the screams enter all of our heads
		- Sanar tells him to get out of our heads
		- He apologizes for his 'disability' and agrees to back up so as to not disturb us
	- [[Lord Rahadin]] states we are being invited due to our deeds and our ability to survive [[Barovia (Country)|Barovia]] thus far
		- Nox is curious if [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] would be allowed to leave
			- As long as we obey all of the rules of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s invitation
			- But, if Ireena finds her love while there then she will wish to stay on her own
				- Sanar asks if this love will be free of magical interference?
				- [[Lord Rahadin|Rahadin]] says no, it is much more than that, we wouldn't understand
- [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] opens the letter
	- _My friends,_
	  _I have been quite impressed with your time in my land. It was a pleasure meeting you in Vallaki and sparring with you all, both verbally and physically. You are all unique individuals. I bid you dine at my castle so that we can meet in civilized surroundings and discuss various matters that were alluded to in our previous conversations._

	  _Your passage will be a secure one. I guarantee a safe journey and stay within [[Castle Ravenloft]], so long as your party agrees to maintain chivalry and respect the sanctity of my home's artifacts and its inhabitants_

	  _Dinner is at 6:30 PM promptly on the 14th of this month. Please dress appropriately. I shall have a carriage to take you part of the way; it shall wait for you past the windmill on the Svalich Road.

	  _I await your arrival._
	  _Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]]_
- We talk to Nox about his experience with Izek and why he left Klepto and Sanar to go hunt [[Izek Strazni|Rozan]]
	- He didn't deserve to be brought back to life when others much more good people should be alive, not him
	- He's dangerous and we'll likely cross his path again
	- Nox still isn't used to others helping him
		- Ireena says that Nox helps others, we just want to help him back
- Approach a bridge which crosses over Luna River, after which we come across a crossroads
	- Broken sign with directions lies in the grass off the road
	- Sanar and Klepto put the sign back together in order to figure out where to go
		- Follow sign southwest towards [[Krezk]], the direction we were told the Winery was
