## Navigating the Death House

As we navigated the [[Death House]] in search of the baby brother of Rose and Thorn, we discovered some secret items and put together what happened in the House.  We figured out that the baby was the bastard child of Mr. Durst and the mistress and Mrs. Durst hated the child.  Within the house we found a bloody book with pages filled with details of the reader's past, but nothing of the future.  We also found a letter: [[Strahd Letter to Dursts]].  We also encountered some animated armor that attacked us.

A beaten [[Klepto]] made his way to the Nightmare Inn and the barkeep said there was a present for him.  [[Stanamir]] left [[Klepto]] a bottle of wine.  He drank the wine and was immediately teleported outside the [[Death House]].  He browsed through the house and eventually joined our group after recognizing [[Kali Rouge|Kali]].

Meanwhile, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] continued to explore the upstairs where he discovered more of the lore of the Dursts. We eventually found the ghosts of Rose and Thorn in a locked room.  We asked them where the entrance to the basement is and they revealed it using their doll house.  Asking the ghosts what the kids were outside, they told us, "Oh that's the house.  Its magical."  

We left Rose and Thorn's ghosts and made our way to the basement where the hallways shrunk down to prevent passing each other.  As we descended further down and heard chanting in the distance.  A nasty worm-like creature made hit and run attacks in the dark hallways and Shadows joined in the assault.  We followed the creature down a stairwell and killed in what appeared to be a central room that connected to several bedrooms.  Down in the basement we also found family crypts, untouched.
