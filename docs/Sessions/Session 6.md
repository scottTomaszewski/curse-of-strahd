# Session 6

## Raw


- Traveling about an hour when we find an "unkindness" of ravens in a tree
	- ireena puts 2 fingers to her heart and bows heads
		- ravens = good luck
		- to harm = bad luck
		- possibly originated with mother night
	- in relation to strahd, people may hide because it could be seen as treasonous, but ireena is unsure

We get to a crossroads (1 hour later)

- The treasure lies in a dragonâ€™s house, in hands once clean and now corrupted.

Sword of Sunlight

- What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.

Your Ally

- Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong.

Strahd's Location (when you want to find him)
