### Notes
#### Speaking of Souls
- [[Luvash]] speaks with [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]], [[Kali Rouge|Kali]], [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]], and [[Klepto]]
	- Brings back up that [[Bluto]] seemed pretty out of it
	- Called it - _Fara Suflet_ - Vistani word for mindless, heartless, those w/o souls
		- Mists keeps the souls from leaving, but eventually they get reincarnated over time
		- However, they've been noticing souls disappearing from the pool of reincarnation
- Unbeknownst to some denizens of [[Barovia (Country)|Barovia]], there are some around without souls
	- [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] states they call them mist touched - believe their spirits are choked by the fog around us
	- States that [[Eric]] from the Blood on the Vine Tavern is mist touched
- They tend to be more compliant and depressed, dull and muted individuals, lack creativity
- [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] asks how it works
	- [[Luvash]] is unsure
	- [[Klepto]] is curious if he ever had a soul?
		- [[Luvash]] says no - then it seems as though some are born w/o souls
- Souls may be disappearing through hole in the mist? or something is consuming them?
- [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] asks if [[Pidlwick II]] has a soul
	- Clear he doesn't as it is a construct
- While consider where to go next the party considers staying w/ the Vistani for the rest of the day
	- [[Luvash]] states they wouldn't have enough wine to go around, they haven't gotten a delivery in some time
	- [[Davian Martikov]] is their contact from the Wizard of Wine- same last name as [[Urwin Martikov]]

#### Approaching [[Nox Vita|Nox]]
- Party approaches [[Nox Vita|Nox]] as he is talking to the rings on the end of the chain around his neck
	- Seems to be talking to Amare, his friend from his previous group - Sodality 
	- [[Pidlwick II]] sneaks up on [[Nox Vita|Nox]], who seems to be extremely unsettled by it's presence
- [[Nox Vita|Nox]] explains that the past day was really dark, and he is uncomfortable
	- [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] apologizes for things getting out of hand
	- [[Nox Vita|Nox]] knows attempting to kill a child is terrible, but [[Bluto]] was a husk
		- Punishing him with death is no different than what he was going to do to [[Arabelle]]
		- Everything is morally grey
- [[Nox Vita|Nox]] asks if [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] has a child
	- He did, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] says he was supposed to
- [[Nox Vita|Nox]] doesn't want [[Pidlwick II]] to join them
	- It seems to like [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]], [[Klepto]] is roughly able to command it to do things
	- Listens to [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] to stay behind as [[Nox Vita|Nox]] taunts it
- [[Sanar]] joins back up with the group and is seen itching his arm
	- [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] asks if he has learned anything, [[Sanar]] states he still has some processing to do

#### Back to Valaki
- Different guards, confirm with our previous documentation, generally less of a hassle then last time
- As soon as we enter we see a small crowd of people, laughter and smiles, which seems weird
	- Court jester in the center, colorful (but not [[Vistani]] colorful), performing a puppet show
	- No apparent meaning to the story he is telling
	- _[[Rictavio]]'s Carnival of Wonders
- Eventually we come across a church - [[Church of Saint Andral]] 
	- Stained windows depicting pious saints, gravestones behind wrought iron fence
	- Decide to come back later, [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] agrees
- Work our way towards the Market
	- On the way we cross the town square, which appears to be the center of the town's festivals
		- Center of square is statue of man facing west, platform around him holds gallows
