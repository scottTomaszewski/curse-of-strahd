# Session 7

## Waking in the Vistani Encampment

As the sun rose on a new day, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] were early to rise.  As [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] sat by the fire quietly, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] attempted a ritual similar to before (See [[Session 5#Waking at the Burgomaster Manor]]) with a severe hangover and failed. [[Sanar]] wakes contemplating the [[Session 6#Madam Eva tells our Fortunes|fortunes told the night before]] and examines the Spell Book acquired from [[Session 5#Battle for the Leather Bundle|the Ankheg nests]], finding it mostly illegible save for `Find Familiar`, `Alarm`, and `Detect Magic`. [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] wakes with sore feet from the extensive travels, but [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] encourages her, then he converses with [[Klepto]] about their commonalities in tinkering: Nirin with his [[Nirin Eze#Arm]] claiming he didn't make it, and Klepto with his [[Klepto#Eldritch Cannon]].

[[Klepto]] asked [[Stanamir]] if there were merchants in the [[Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment]], was told "no", but was told there were some at the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]].  When asked about the haunted gallows from [[Session 6#Walking to the Tser Pool]], [[Stanamir]] said he's never seen any bodies hung from them before. 

[[Sanar]] reassured [[Nox Vita|Nox]] that although he may be a [[Dusk Elves|Drow]], he is not a follower of Lolth and was not at Silverymoon during the [[Storm of Ash]], although [[Nox Vita|Nox]] did not remember the story he told the night before during [[Session 6#Contemplating our Fortunes]], but confirmed to [[Sanar]] that he knows that [[Sanar]] would never do such a thing.

Moving focus to [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]], [[Sanar]] asked him if he was being truthful about his [[Vampirism|Vampiric]] heritage since his [[Session 6#Personal Readings]] seemed to indicate there was an ancestry of the trait.  [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] confirmed that he is still unsure of the origin of his transformation nor did his family share any information with him.

When [[Sanar]] was asked why he wanted to speak with [[Madam Eva]] alone, he shared that he crossed paths with the [[King Maker]] and was curious about the implications.

We agreed to remain a group for the time being since our paths seem to align.

## Speaking with Stanamir

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] took [[Stanamir]] aside and asked him about the symbol found on his [[Nirin Eze#Arm]].  [[Stanamir]] thought the symbol reminded him of the deity Tyr, but typically the scales rest on a Warhammer and there isn't an angel nor devil.  [[Stanamir]] casts Detect Magic on the symbol and sees that its magical in nature, but is unable to pinpoint the School of magic - possibly conjuration or illusion.  He suggests [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] focus on it, touch it, etc.

[[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] joined the conversation and asked [[Stanamir]] what was happening to him.  [[Stanamir]] observed that [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] may be a [[Vampirism#Dhampir]] as he seems similar to ones he's seen in other realms.  Oddly, that would require being bitten from [[Stanamir|Stanamir's]] knowledge, but [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] doesn't recall those events.

When finished getting ready, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] also joins the conversation and asks [[Stanamir]] about the Shriveled Goblin Hand he found in the [[Death House]] ([[Session 3#Walters Lair]]), but [[Stanamir]] finds it ordinary.

[[Stanamir]] gives us some basic directions and we depart.

## Journey to the Svalich Road Bridge

We travel for a few hours along the [[Svalich Woods#Road]] and come to a waterfall with a [[Svalich Woods#Bridge and Waterfall]] 1000ft above.

Instead of climbing, we choose to walk the path and as we approach the bridge we notice Dark Gargoyles decorating it.  Using his Proto-Dragon Familiar as a scout, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] notices several bodies on the other side of the bridge.  We approach and find footprints leading to and from the bodies, into the woods, and one set that seem to leave the area.  After our investigation, we conclude that a barefoot vampire drained the blood of the victims and slashed the throats of another set of bodies in the woods.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] made a sketch of the barefoot prints and pocketed some coin from the bodies which we determined to be of the raging mob we first encountered in [[Session 4#Traveling to the Blood on the Vine Tavern]].  [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] tells us this is what happens to those that attempt to stand up to [[Strahd von Zarovich]] as [[Nox Vita|Nox]] gives them their last rites in the name of the [[Morning Lord]].

In discussing the implications of this, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] and [[Sanar]] posture that [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is testing us - that he could easily overpower the party and take [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] if he wanted, but for some reason he chooses not to.  [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] notes that the footprints may not be of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself, but other [[Vampirism|Vampires]] under [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's command]].  [[Sanar]] asks if [[Lord Rahadin]] is also a [[Vampirism|vampire]], but [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] doubts it.

Before progressing, the morning's travels bring on the reminder of the delicious [[Morgantha#Pies]] eaten previously: [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] have cravings, but fight them off.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] on the other hand cannot resist and is consumed by the desire for pies (disadvantage).  On the rest of the journey he repeatedly runs ahead, then waits for everyone to catch up, eager to get his hands on more [[Morgantha#Pies]] in [[Vallaki]].

## Travel to the Western Gates

Leaving the bodies behind, we continue our travels down the [[Svalich Woods#Road]].  [[Nox Vita|Nox]] asked about the story he told the night before ([[Session 6#Contemplating our Fortunes]]) and [[Sanar]] filled in the details of the story shared of the [[Storm of Ash]] and the two confide in each other - [[Nox Vita|Nox]] revealing more information about his previous party, [[Nox Vita#Sodality|Sodality]].

We come to a fork in the road with a signpost labeled

- [[Castle Ravenloft]] pointing East
	- Has a once-nice cobblestone road
- [[Vallaki]], [[Berez]], and [[Krezk]] pointing West

[[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] updates us that [[Berez]] is the fourth village that supposedly existed. Her rumor matched that of [[Morgantha]] saying that it was swallowed up by the flooded [[Lake Zarovich#River|river]] hundreds of years ago.

We head West towards [[Vallaki]] and as the sun continues to set as [[Nirin Eze|Nirin's]] [[Morgantha#Pies|pie]] craving continues.  We approach two headless statues between large cliffs, exactly like the [[Barovia Village#Gates of Barovia]] where we prepare camp for the night.


## Night on Svalich Road

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri's]] Raven Familiar take the first watch and shorty see a shadowy figure step out from a tree. His eye's flash and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] displays trust and friendship in conversation.  The figure introduces themselves as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and asks about our purpose in the woods and for a Gold Piece.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] shares that we are traveling to [[Vallaki]] and although he doesn't have any Gold, he offers tobacco instead, which [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] accepts.  The two continue formalities and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] conveys that he wants to ensure safe travels and he wishes to help.  Before disappearing into the night, he requests [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] let [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] know that he says "Hello".

Breaking from the charm, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] reflects on what just happened and asks his [[Nirin Eze#Armband]], "What are you?", but there is no response.
