# Session 7

[Youtube - Curse of Strahd Session 7](https://youtu.be/WwnwxbPVrGQ)

## Waking in the Vistani Encampment

As the sun rose on a new day, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] were early to rise.  As [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] sat by the fire quietly, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] attempted a ritual similar to before (See [[Session 5#Waking at the Burgomaster Manor]]) with a severe hangover and failed. [[Sanar]] wakes contemplating the [[Session 6#Madam Eva tells our Fortunes|fortunes told the night before]] and examines the Spell Book acquired from [[Session 5#Battle for the Leather Bundle|the Ankheg nests]], finding it mostly illegible save for `Find Familiar`, `Alarm`, and `Detect Magic`. [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] wakes with sore feet from the extensive travels, but [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] encourages her, then he converses with [[Klepto]] about their commonalities in tinkering: Nirin with his [[Nirin Eze#Arm]] claiming he didn't make it, and Klepto with his [[Klepto#Eldritch Cannon]].

[[Klepto]] asked [[Stanamir]] if there were merchants in the [[Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment]], was told "no", but was told there were some at the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]].  When asked about the haunted gallows from [[Session 6#Walking to the Tser Pool]], [[Stanamir]] said he's never seen any bodies hung from them before. 

[[Sanar]] reassured [[Nox Vita|Nox]] that although he may be a [[Dusk Elves|Drow]], he is not a follower of Lolth and was not at Silverymoon during the [[Storm of Ash]], although [[Nox Vita|Nox]] did not remember the story he told the night before during [[Session 6#Contemplating our Fortunes]], but confirmed to [[Sanar]] that he knows that [[Sanar]] would never do such a thing.

Moving focus to [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]], [[Sanar]] asked him if he was being truthful about his [[Vampirism|Vampiric]] heritage since his [[Session 6#Personal Readings]] seemed to indicate there was an ancestry of the trait.  [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] confirmed that he is still unsure of the origin of his transformation nor did his family share any information with him.

When [[Sanar]] was asked why he wanted to speak with [[Madam Eva]] alone, he shared that he crossed paths with the [[King Maker]] and was curious about the implications.

We agreed to remain a group for the time being since our paths seem to align.

## Speaking with Stanamir

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] took [[Stanamir]] aside and asked him about the symbol found on his [[Nirin Eze#Arm]].  [[Stanamir]] thought the symbol reminded him of the deity Tyr, but typically the scales rest on a Warhammer and there isn't an angel nor devil.  [[Stanamir]] casts Detect Magic on the symbol and sees that its magical in nature, but is unable to pinpoint the School of magic - possibly conjuration or illusion.  He suggests [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] focus on it, touch it, etc.

[[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] joined the conversation and asked [[Stanamir]] what was happening to him.  [[Stanamir]] observed that [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] may be a [[Vampirism#Dhampir]] as he seems similar to ones he's seen in other realms.  Oddly, that would require being bitten from [[Stanamir|Stanamir's]] knowledge, but [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] doesn't recall those events.

When finished getting ready, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] also joins the conversation and asks [[Stanamir]] about the Shriveled Goblin Hand he found in the [[Death House]] ([[Session 3#Walters Lair]]), but [[Stanamir]] finds it ordinary.

[[Stanamir]] gives us some basic directions and we depart.

## Journey to the Svalich Road Bridge

We travel for a few hours along the [[Svalich Woods#Road]] and come to a waterfall with a [[Svalich Woods#Bridge and Waterfall]] 1000ft above.

![[Svalich Road Bridge and Waterfall.png]]

Instead of climbing, we choose to walk the path and as we approach the bridge we notice Dark Gargoyles decorating it.  Using his Proto-Dragon Familiar as a scout, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] notices several bodies on the other side of the bridge.  We approach and find footprints leading to and from the bodies, into the woods, and one set that seem to leave the area.  After our investigation, we conclude that a barefoot vampire drained the blood of the victims and slashed the throats of another set of bodies in the woods.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] made a sketch of the barefoot prints and pocketed some coin from the bodies which we determined to be of the raging mob we first encountered in [[Session 4#Traveling to the Blood on the Vine Tavern]].  [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] tells us this is what happens to those that attempt to stand up to [[Strahd von Zarovich]] as [[Nox Vita|Nox]] gives them their last rites in the name of the [[Morning Lord]].

In discussing the implications of this, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] and [[Sanar]] posture that [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is testing us - that he could easily overpower the party and take [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] if he wanted, but for some reason he chooses not to.  [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] notes that the footprints may not be of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself, but other [[Vampirism|Vampires]] under [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's command]].  [[Sanar]] asks if [[Lord Rahadin]] is also a [[Vampirism|vampire]], but [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] doubts it.

Before progressing, the morning's travels bring on the reminder of the delicious [[Dream Pie]] eaten previously: [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] have cravings, but fight them off.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] on the other hand cannot resist and is consumed by the desire for [[Dream Pie]] (disadvantage).  On the rest of the journey he repeatedly runs ahead, then waits for everyone to catch up, eager to get his hands on more [[Dream Pie]] in [[Vallaki]].

## Travel to the Western Gates

Leaving the bodies behind, we continue our travels down the [[Svalich Woods#Road]].  [[Nox Vita|Nox]] asked about the story he told the night before ([[Session 6#Contemplating our Fortunes]]) and [[Sanar]] filled in the details of the story shared of the [[Storm of Ash]] and the two confide in each other - [[Nox Vita|Nox]] revealing more information about his previous party, [[Nox Vita#Sodality|Sodality]].

We come to a fork in the road with a signpost labeled

- [[Castle Ravenloft]] pointing East
	- Has a once-nice cobblestone road
- [[Vallaki]], [[Berez]], and [[Krezk]] pointing West

[[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] updates us that [[Berez]] is the fourth village that supposedly existed. Her rumor matched that of [[Morgantha]] saying that it was swallowed up by the flooded [[Lake Zarovich#River|river]] hundreds of years ago.

We head West towards [[Vallaki]] and as the sun continues to set as [[Nirin Eze|Nirin's]] [[Dream Pie]] craving continues.  We approach two headless statues between large cliffs, exactly like the [[Barovia Village#Gates of Barovia]] where we prepare camp for the night.


## Night on Svalich Road

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri's]] Raven Familiar take the first watch and shorty see a shadowy figure step out from a tree. His eye's flash and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] displays trust and friendship in conversation.  The figure introduces themselves as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and asks about our purpose in the woods and for a Gold Piece.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] shares that we are traveling to [[Vallaki]] and although he doesn't have any Gold, he offers tobacco instead, which [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] accepts.  The two continue formalities and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] conveys that he wants to ensure safe travels and he wishes to help.  Before disappearing into the night, he requests [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] let [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] know that he says "Hello".

Breaking from the charm, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] reflects on what just happened and asks his [[Nirin Eze#Armband]], "What are you?", but there is no response.  "Have I made a mistake?", and the devil goes down (no).  As a control, he asks if his name is "Nirin", the angel goes down (yes).  "Are you Tyr?", angel drops (yes).

[[Kali Rouge|Kali]] and [[Sanar]] take second watch, asking [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] if there is anything to worry about, but he declines, then [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] sets up a telepathic connection with [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] to find [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] is having nightmares and weeps.  [[Sanar]] asks [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] about her relationship with [[Klepto]] and she shares that the [[Klepto#Eldritch Cannon]] wasn't always with him.  [[Sanar]] shares that the turret is sentient and doesn't seem to want to be under [[Klepto|Klepto's]] control.  When asked about his powers, [[Sanar]] tells her that he practiced them as a child under his [[Sanar#Father|father's]] watch and he assumes he inherited the powers from him.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] shares that her powers are recent and came from an explosion.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] asked [[Sanar]] about his views of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and [[Sanar]] replies that after [[#Journey to the Svalich Road Bridge|today's discovery]], he definitely seems more evil than at first.

[[Nox Vita|Nox]] and [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] take third watch as [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] crafts with her Embroidery Kit and asks [[Nox Vita|Nox]] about his hobbies.  [[Nox Vita|Nox]] says he doesn't really have many hobbies, he just helps people. [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] shares that she wants to heal people with her Embroidery via magic or plants.  [[Nox Vita|Nox]] asks how [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] is doing with the loss of her [[Kolyan Indirovich|father]], then goes off to attempt his [[Nox Vita#Box|ritual]] again, but fails.

When we wake, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] discovers he lost his Shriveled Goblin Hand (likely taken by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] during his ritual) and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] makes no mention of his encounter with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] the night before.

## Discovering the Windmill of Morgantha

We continue our travels and come across a mossy tablet with a rough carving of a wolf's head.  With [[Sanar]] noting it was thousands of years old, [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] made a quick sketch of it and we briefly discussed naming our group.

Another hour into our walk, Old Svalich Road transitions into a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside and we descend into a valley. We come across a hill with a [[Windmill Bakery|windmill]] on top - one that looks similar if not identical to the windmills we saw in the [[Death House]].  Seeing a small [[Twig Figurine]] on the ground, we detect the delicious smell of pie and [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] sends his familiar to scout the area.  Inside the windmill is [[Bella]], an old woman with hair up in a mound and hands covered in dough who says, "Look at you!  What the fuck?!"  

We enter the [[Windmill Bakery]] to find pastries being baked and more [[Twig Figurine|Twig Doll]] are in the corner of the room.  [[Bella]] hollers for her sister, [[Ophalia]] and says that their mother [[Morgantha]] will be home soon.  Complimenting the pies, we buy 3 more for `1gp` each and get one for free and [[Bella]] says that she is "happy that people appreciate their work: to make people in [[Barovia]] happy," but [[Sanar]] mentions that the people don't seem happy.

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] immediately consumers one of the [[Dream Pie|pies]] and [[Sanar]] questions how the people of [[Barovia]] can afford to pay `1gp` per pie.  [[Bella]] mentions there is wealth in the valley, even if they don't look it the people have money.

Asking about the [[Twig Figurine|Twig Doll]], [[Bella]] informs us that they make them themselves and are for "decoration" and we are led to believe her.

Outside, [[Klepto]] notices many [[Ravens]] circling above.

### The Four Stone Square

As we depart, we quickly visit the [[Windmill Bakery#Four Stone Square]] nearby which [[Bella]] says is the remnant from an old building.  [[Morgantha]] joins us and states its a place of power, dark, requires sacrifice.  We depart, and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] asks [[Morgantha|Granny]] if she knows anything about his [[Nirin Eze#Armband]], but she says she doesn't.  As he departs, the devil side of his [[Nirin Eze#Armband]] descends, "No."

## Travel from the Windmill to Vallaki

On our way to [[Vallaki]] we encounter a man on the road leading a Draft Horse who introduced himself as [[Arrigal]], one of the leaders of the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]].  [[Arrigal]] was bring in supplies from outside [[Barovia]] and described [[Vallaki]] as a "powder keg" - everyone is tightly wound up and they are unfriendly towards the [[Vistani]], with the exception of the [[Blue Water Inn]].

[[Arrigal]] mentioned [[Blinsky's Toys]] and Klepto asked what kind of toys [[Arabelle]] liked.  [[Arrigal]] said they only have creepy toys.  We also chatted about the protection of [[Church of St Andral]] and books in [[Vallaki]]. [[Arrigal]] suggested we check out "Van Richten's Guide to Monster Slaying."

When we asked about [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Arrigal]] said he likes him, he treats the [[Vistani]] well, and doesn't care that he treats rest of people poorly, the people treat themselves poorly.

Asking to stay in the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]], [[Klepto]] shows [[Arrigal]] the note from [[Eliza]] which should help convince his brother [[Luvash]] to welcome the party.   [[Arrigal]] also shared that the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]] is home to a [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment#Dusk Elf Encampment]].

## Vallaki to the Vallaki Vistani Encampment

As we approach the [[Vallaki]] Gate we notice dozens of wolf heads on stakes - which are new according to [[Arrigal]] and he mentions that the guards can be dicks sometimes. After some discussion, the guards let [[Arrigal]], the "dirty vistani", and the party go around without issue - the Gates are closed for the night and we head around towards the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment]].

[[Arrigal]] mentions that [[Dusk Elves]] are not _as_ disliked as [[Vistani]], but they tend to not enter [[Vallaki]] - there is also a half [[Dusk Elves|Dusk Elf]] who owns the [[Vallaki#Tannery]].

When asked about the relationship between the [[Vistani]] and the others, [[Arrigal]] says the "dislike goes both ways," but he "just wants to look out for his own people."

## Entering the Vallaki Vistani Encampment

We arrive at large [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment|encampment]], full of covered wagons and the scent of wine and horses.  [[Arrigal]] points to hovels built into the hills where the [[Vallaki Vistani Encampment#Dusk Elf Encampment]] is.  We hear yelling from a brightly lit tent in the center of the camp where a bear of a man, [[Luvash]] was scolding a teenage boy, [[Alexei]] for losing his daughter [[Arabelle]] and rages that she "never listens".  [[Luvash]] requests that we [[Return Arabelle to the Vistani Encampment]] and gives us [[Arabelle]]'s favorite bronze necklace to help her notice us
