# Session 8

[Youtube - Curse of Strahd Session 8](https://youtu.be/uhK_dL29c_E)

## Traveling to the Vallaki Gates

As we approach the [[Vallaki#Gate]], [[Sanar]] asks for change for `1sp` and we discuss our tactics for entering the village.  [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] offers to use the clout of her name to enter and [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] expresses concern our identities being revealed, but [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] doesn't seem worried.  At the very least, [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] suggests we should use her name to get an audience with the [[Vallaki Burgomaster]]

[[Klepto]]'s [[Klepto#Eldritch Cannon]] sharpened its nails without external help which interested [[Klepto]].  Seeing the hand was interested in communicating, [[Sanar]] reached out to the hand and it repeated its [[Session 06#Wolf Ambush|threats]].  [[Sanar]] requests the hand stay calm in [[Vallaki]] and it seems to comply, but continues to express it's desire to kill [[Sanar]] and/or [[Klepto]].

## Entering Vallaki

At the gate, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] took the lead on gaining entry, stating they are on a [[Return Arabelle to the Vistani Encampment|case for a missing person]] and we shouldn't keep [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] waiting.  Although they are suspicious of [[Nox Vita|Nox]] and [[Klepto]], they let us in and ask for documentation.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] gives them the name [[Kali Rouge#Meg Ashrunner|Meg Ashrunner]], [[Sanar]] gives the name [[Sanar#Eresse|Eresse]], and a panicked [[Nox Vita|Nox]] gives [[Nox Vita#Vox Nita]]. The others shared their real information.  When asked about our opinion of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Kali Rouge|Meg Ashrunner]] acts like she doesn't know who he is, "being new to the town and all."

Seemingly satisfied, the guards give a rundown of the [[Vallaki#Laws]] - including that we must [[Attend Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in 3 days.  [[Sanar]] asked the guards why [[Dusk Elves]] and [[Vistani]] aren't allowed in and they said, "[[Dusk Elves]] are allowed in, but they are a broken people; there's not many of them" and "[[Vistani]] are vagabonds, not to be trusted, and likely in league with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]."  [[Blue Water Inn]] was suggested as a fine resting point for the night.

While registering our weapons, [[Kali Rouge|Meg Ashrunner]] continued to rant about where she can get changed and [[Sanar]] attempted to Suggest otherwise, but failed. Weapons bought in town will automatically be registered.  The guard directs us the the [[Church of St Andral]].

As we walked, [[Sanar]] expressed his disappointment in [[Ireena Kolyanovich|Ireena]] sharing her influence immediately and that [[Klepto]] mentioned that we were searching for [[Vistani]].
