# Session 1

(sorry I didnt take good notes)

## Intro

All (except [[Klepto]]) meet in the Nightmare Stables Inn and have some brief introductions.  Eventually we make our way to a [[Vistani]] Caravan that is in town.  We are greeted by [[Stanamir]] who invites us to share personal stories about our lives. Once finished, he shares a story of his own.  One where he described nursing a man back to health.  He wanted to see his family - brother and mother.  The man was hunted, but we described as a prince, commander, warrior, and wizard.  We are led to believe this is none other than [[Strahd von Zarovich]].

[[Stanamir]] then told us that a [[Vistani]] woman, [[Madam Eva]], wanted to see us and we could fine her "at the crossroads of the [[Tser Pool]]."  He then offered us exquisite wine and offered us to sleep at the caravan for the evening.

That night we all had nightmares of sorts - ones that were familiar to us.

When we woke, we were in a forest surrounded by mist that seemed to encroach on us.  The majority of our equipment was gone, save for some tools and trinkets. A picnic basket greeted us with a letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich]] welcoming us.  Within the basket was a Healing Potion for each of us, some cheese, and a bottle of wine. 

As we traveled in the opposite direction of the mist, we found the [[Death House]] with two children out front: Rose and Thorn. They told us that they were instructed to watch their little brother who was upstairs.  [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] climbed the walls of the [[Death House|house]] as the rest of us crept inside.  Within we found the house was themed with pictures of Lighthouses and we acquired some equipment.  Within one room, we found some pipes and a [[Tarokka Deck]].
