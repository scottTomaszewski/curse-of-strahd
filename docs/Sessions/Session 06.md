# Session 6

[Youtube: Curse of Strahd Session 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkI1Ff3OY-k)

## Walking to the Tser Pool

After leaving [[Barovia Village]], we made our way to the [[Tser Pool]].  We traveled for about an hour and came across an "unkindness" of [[Ravens]] were seen perched in a tree.  As we passed, [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] put two fingers to her heart and bowed her head telling us that ravens represent good luck and to kill one is said to bring on bad luck - the origin may be related to the [[Mother Night]].  When asked why the people hide it, Ireena said that recognition of the raven may be seen as treasonous against [[Strahd von Zarovich]] - but she wasn't entire sure of that.

We eventually reach a the Crossroads the we saw in our dream in [[Session 04#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor]].  

![[Tser Pool Crossroads.png]]

To our left was an empty gallows, to our right was 11 unmarked gravestones seemingly undisturbed for some time.  The sign post pointing Northwest read "[[Tser Pool]]" and the hill slanted downwards.  The post pointing Southwest read "Ravenloft" and "[[Vallaki]]" as the hill slanted upwards in that direction.  Another post pointed East and was labeled "[[Barovia Village|Barovia]]."  As we departed this injunction, we heard rope swinging in the wind and where once the gallows was empty, now hung a corpse (male, 55 years old, tattered clothing) to all of us, but [[Sanar]] saw his own corpse hanging there. [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] asked if [[Sanar]] had died before, but he said he hadn't - covering the encounter within the [[Session 03#Death House Basement]].

As we walked, [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] shared that most people in [[Barovia]] have a negative perspective on the [[Vistani]], but she had little experience with them herself.  

## Wolf Ambush

We soon heard the sound of screaming out and the howls of [[Strahd von Zarovich#Wolves|wolves]].  [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] informed us there are two kinds of wolves in [[Barovia]]- the "normal" kind, and a much larger and more dangerous variant.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] led the charge and we came to a group of 4 horse-sized wolves fighting an unusual Zombie equipped with leather armor, a longsword, and eyes that were vibrant with life.  As we approached, 4 more wolves leaped out of some nearby bushed and attacked our party.  

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] was downed twice, but Nox quickly brought him back into the fight.  We downed the wolves while the Zombie took down his 4 himself.  [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] even got the killing blow on one and [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]]'s Familiar put another to sleep.  When [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] joined the fight, the wolves seemed to be extra cautious around her, careful not to step on her or harm her in any way.

After the battle, we speak with the Zombie who introduces himself as [[Sir Gaheris de Karaheu]] of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]].  He stated his purpose was to hunt the agents of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], that he doesn't like Strahd.  He did warn however that we should not interfere with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] leadership in any way - he must suffer the consequences of what he had brought about.  Before departing abruptly, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] asked how he was "undead, but not dead" to which he responded, "Vengeance keeps me alive."

Before moving on, [[Klepto]] examined his new turret bot and [[Sanar]] took the opportunity to show solidarity by asking if it was sentient.  With [[Klepto]] unsure, [[Sanar]] attempted to communicate with the bot telepathically.  The turret immediately yelled out, "GIVE ME BACK MY HAND!"  [[Sanar]] responded, "Whose hand?  Who are you?"  The turret returned, "YOU STOLE MY SWORD, WHEN I FIND YOU I WILL RIP YOU INTO PIECES!" and [[Sanar]] ended the telepathy and told [[Klepto]] that they have much to discuss in the future.

## Tser Pool Vistani Encampment

As we made our way along, we eventually see the tracks of wagons and we reach the [[Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment]] with 8 horses, wagons, and the group of [[Vistani]] we were seeking.

![[Tser Pool Vistani Camp.png]]

We are immediately welcomed in by [[Stanamir]] who hugs us and joyously gives us wine to drink.  [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] looks tense, but she tries to break from the fearful traditions of her [[Ismark Kolyanovich|brother]] and [[Kolyan Indirovich|father]].  We ask [[Stanamir]] some questions:

Why can the [[Vistani]] leave, but others cant?

- Maybe because the [[Vistani]] saved the prince (from the story told in [[Session 01]])
- The [[Vistani]] and [[Strahd von Zarovich]] have a mutual respect
	- If the Vistani dont break [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s rules, then they are free to come and go
- Clarified that the [[Vistani]] are not servants of Strahd, but he is not surprised that others think they are allies

Asked about the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]]

- [[Stanamir]] knows little of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]], but he does see them occasionally
- The [[Vistani]] and the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]] mutually don't mess with each other

When asked about [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] being smuggled out of [[Barovia]], [[Stanamir]] said that he was not involved with that.  It was a small [[Vistani]] family who had been removed, to be [[Ex Vistani]].  That family has been dealt with, likely by [[Strahd von Zarovich]].  He also clarified that there are some [[Vistani]] that wander freely, and these are not [[Ex Vistani]].

## Madam Eva tells our Fortunes

We venture into [[Madam Eva]]'s tent with [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] where we find a crystal ball on a table surrounded by pillows for sitting and a chair sat on by [[Madam Eva]].  We each placed the cards we previously received down before us and power coursed through [[Madam Eva]]'s veins as she held the [[Tarokka Deck]].  [[Madam Eva]] drew three cards from the [[Tarokka Deck#Common Deck]] and two from the [[Tarokka Deck#High Cards]].  She then drew 1 card for each of us from the [[Tarokka Deck#High Cards]] and said, " The threads of fate have spoken to me..."

![[Tarroka Card Reading.png]]

[[Madam Eva]] first revealed the center cards revealing the future of our group:

### Knowledge of the Past

- Common Card 1 - `9 of Glyphs`
- This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
- A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek.

### Holy Symbol

- Common Card 2 - `8 of Glyphs`
- This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
- The treasure lies in a dragonâ€™s house, in hands once clean and now corrupted.

### Sword of Sunlight

- Common Card 3 - `5 of Stars`
- This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.
- What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.

### Your Ally

- High Card 1 - `DonJon`
- This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
- Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong.

### Strahd's Location 

- High Card 2 - `Seer`
- This is the location of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] (when you want to find him)
- Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!
- He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.

### Personal Readings

[[Madam Eva]] then revealed and interpreted the cards for each of us.

| Character             | Given Card (Common Card) | Drawn Card (High Card) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| [[Demetri Bebanburg]] | Necromancer              | Artifact               |
| [[Kali Rouge]]        | Avenger                  | Broken One             |
| [[Klepto]]            | Rogue                    | Executioner            |
| [[Nirin Eze]]         | Illusionist              | Tempter                |
| [[Nox Vita]]          | Anarchist                | Ghost                  |
| [[Sanar]]             | Enchanter                | Beast                  |

We asked [[Madam Eva]] why she was helping and she said, "My Inner eye told me you were coming and I was to help."  She is known to [[Nox Vita|Nox]] as "The Veiled Lady" when asking if she was a deity. She told him she was just a fortune teller, "What I was previously is of no consequence." and that the gods would not help and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] must find his own path.

[[Klepto]] asked if the Execution was his own and [[Madam Eva]] responded that, "the threads of fate can combine past, present and future.  What will it be? That is your choice..."  We also found out that although the [[Vistani]] travel, [[Madam Eva]] remains and finds joy in helping champions.  As for [[Strahd von Zarovich]], she said her will didn't matter, but we were instructed to "follow the cards and their fate.  We may escape and bring a better life to those in [[Barovia]]."  [[Madam Eva]] refused to do a reading for [[Ireena Kolyanovich]], but she was capable of doing so.

When asked about the [[King Maker]] by [[Sanar]], [[Madam Eva]] told him that if he desires power and success, the [[King Maker]] will grant it, but if asking for understanding, she cannot give him that. For understanding, he can seek out the [[Mountainfolk]] where a [[Shaman]] may be able to help him ([[Seek out the Mountainfolk]]), but [[Madam Eva]] does not know the cost of doing so.

## Contemplating our Fortunes 

We all left the tent in series.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] immediately grabbed a jug of wine and traveled down river to sit by a tree.  From a compartment in his arm, he removed a small piece of rope with a loop on the end, then broke down to cry with his mechanical fox nearby.

[[Stanamir]] asks how our travels were and claims that he was not responsible for the way we made it here.  [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] recounted a brief rendition of the events and [[Stanamir]] seemed disappointed in the lack of details.  A heavily intoxicated [[Nox Vita|Nox]] told [[Stanamir]] the story of the [[Storm of Ash|Darkest Night]] - when Silverymoon was attacked by Dark Elves and "Spider Fuckers."  Some of his companions died in the event and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] said they "deserved everything that came to them", but the story trailed off as [[Nox Vita|Nox]] had a Reversal of Fortune and [[Klepto]] assisted him to bed.

[[Stanamir]] then spit into the fire and a Green Flame displayed the story that he began to tell. 4-5 years ago there was a mighty and renowned [[Wizard]] (name forgotten) holding a book - a charismatic leader wearing a black robe and wielding a powerful staff who even created his own spells.  The [[Wizard]] had several companions - a Bugbear, Warrior, and an Archer.  He roused the people of [[Barovia Village]] against [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in [[Castle Ravenloft]].  When they approached, many fled in terror despite [[Strahd von Zarovich]] appearing unarmed and unarmored.  Those that stayed got on their knees and groveled before him, others stood and died outright. The [[Wizard]] fought [[Strahd von Zarovich]] all over the land, taking hits, but remaining in the fight. Eventually [[Strahd von Zarovich]] overtook him and threw his body over a cliff into the [[Tser Pool]], but [[Stanamir]] was unable to find his body - the river must have washed it away...

We asked [[Stanamir]] if his fortune was ever told and came true by [[Madam Eva]] and he said "yes, in a way..." as he looked on to his family nearby.  Once [[Klepto]] finished putting the wasted [[Nox Vita|Nox]] to bed, he was approached by a [[Vistani]] woman named [[Eliza]] who said it was good to have outsiders and asked if we were here to take back [[Castle Ravenloft]].  [[Klepto]] said he was looking for a [[Vistani]] named [[Esmeralda]].  [[Eliza]] did not know her, but [[Barovia]] is the best place to look. After mentioning we were heading to [[Vallaki]], [[Eliza]] asked us to get a [[Name-day gift for Arabelle]].  [[Eliza]] made an antidote and shoved it down [[Nox Vita|Nox's]] throat to help him feel better. 

[[Kali Rouge|Kali]] had a small chat with [[Ireena Kolyanovich]], agreed to head to [[Vallaki]], then went off to search for [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]].  They found him against a tree, miserable, and encouraged him to return to the [[Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment]] for the night.  While grabbing some tobacco and booze for [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] on the way back, [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] noticed a [[Vistani]] woman tying a note to a Magpie (black bird) and sending it off.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] pretends to sleep, leaves the tent for a smoke and to look at the moon, then heads to bed without disturbing anyone.

[[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] and [[Sanar]] have delightful dreams as a result of eating Granny's [[Dream Pie]]
