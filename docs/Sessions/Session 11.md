		- got from ten towns
	- sidgul on the spine "lantamere's somethign somehting" 06:30
		- Nas Lantamere's spellbook (said to player, not to PCs) - one of the 4 primary wizards of Arcane Brotherhood
		- Official: `The wooden covers of Nass’s spellbook are bound in nothic hide, and silver clasps hold the book shut. The sigil of the Arcane Brotherhood is inscribed on the spine, which also bears the title _Lantomir’s Traveling Libram_. The tome contains the following spells: clairvoyance, cloud of daggers, counterspell, detect magic, detect thoughts, find familiar, Melf’s acid arrow, Tenser’s floating disk, and thunderwave.`
	- Klepto helps
		- symbol of the arcane brotherhoods, sourced from Luskan
			- archeologist wizards
	- Nirin asks for incense
		- NAT 20 Luck, Lavash "I do Yoga in the mornings to stay limber"
	- Demetri asks to smoke with Nirin tonight
		- D: Our history is deep enough that i wouldnt expect you to keep secrets
		- N: I know, not used to being with others, dont mean to. Just want to get out of here
		- D: What of these other comrades?
		- N: I think you know how i feel about one of them. Had to deal with people like hiom before. Trying hard to not engage with him
		- D: think his intensions are good, but funny way of showing it sometimes. Doesnt intend on showing us harm.  Just looks out for #1 first. Has stayed with party so far.  No reason to distrust him so far.  Maybe cut him a little slack?
		- N: little hard to trust if he trusts you with nothing
		- D: we need to stick together.  Need all the help we can get... How about that pipe weed
		- *smokes like an old wizard with smoke and his book*
		- D: ah picking up some spells, are we?
		- N: might be able to get something.  It comes from ten towns... ive only heard of it
			- pulls out notebook to take some notes
- Kali and Ireena
	- Ireena shows Kali the present given to her from Strahd
		- Chain "armor", can be worn under armor
	- Kali advises not to wear it until its investigated
		- Ireena has no interest in wearing something from Strahd, but kali can have it
	- Kali asks about the fortune: history intertwined with lord of this land. Possibly related to Strahd's infatuation with Ireena?
		- I: thats what i assume...
	- Small talk about the future
- Nox in the Bluewater inn
	- Sees urwin is busy dealing with stuff
	- Heads to barkeep (dark skin woman, danica martikov)
		- insight: 
			- feels like a powder keg, guards around, there is tension and the baron's effort of motivation is not working
			- vibe that people are looking with awe, fear, "what are they about"
		- N: "do you need help?"
		- D: normally no, but right now I need a hand
			- just handing out drinks tonight (only two drinks)
		- place starts to clear out 
		- *introductions*
		- D: appreciate the help, all good here
		- N: Your husband walking around... few questions... some respect for mother night...?
		- D: true
		- N: what has kept you to her?
		- D: MN is the couterpart to ML.  ML has churches... nothing for MN.  MN is not worhsiped as openly.  Our family just has a long respect for MN
		- N: My God is very similar to MN, but some elements of ML.  Nox finds the darkest elements to be the deepest. when was last time ....
		- D: havent felt MN or had prayers answered for as long as ive known
		- N: how do you worship
		- D: all about shadow ..., respect good and bad, trials and tribulation.  With otu family, we honor her at night by talking about our day.  Represents the idea that MN recognizes who a person is before they die.  To be honest, not sure how she _would_ answer.  ML is not reliable, but works in obvious ways.  MN is more... random.  Makes sense - she is the deity of night and shadows
		- N: how would you talk about this particular day.  MN and ML both did nothing...
		- D: those that have died are to be remembered. joy and loss.  I imagine when we talk about today, we would talk to MN about things in the most neutral way possible.  Good and bad. 
		- N: lots of bad, but good to hang on to balance
		- D: living under warlord for many years, we are grinded down for generations
		- N: thinks "Strahd not that bad...", anything else you need tonight?
		- D: between the two of us... were runnign low on wine.  We have family at the winery, but due to falling out between wizard of wines and husband... they havent talked in a long time. Shipment due a week ago, but no wine.  Urwin too prideful to ask for help.
		- N: perhaps tomorrow Nox can help
		- D: are you staying with us tonight?
		- N: nah ill sleep outside in the rain, save the beds
		- D: hokay
	- Nox sleeps outside behind a barrel, reflecting on his time with all his parties
		- prays to mother night
	- Nox sleeps, deams
		- Giant being - dark.  Resembles being from other dreams
		- Booming voice
			- BV: Nox Vita...
			- N: yes?
			- BV: I have seen and been watching you... you seek the power to raise the ancient dead
			- N: seeks to bring back someone from ....
			- BV: I can provide you with this...
				- (same being as one that helped with the child )
			- N: nox seen your power before.  who are you
			- BV: i go by many names, my earliest one being the Corpse Star
			- N: okay, seems kinda dramatic.  Do you know kalemvor?
			- BV: ive been helping you with yrou travels across the land.  I would like to offer you a boon
			- N: do you know Kalemvor. Thought the help was kalemvor himself.  Do you know him?
			- BV: Kalemvor cannot reach you here.  In this land, i will have to take his place for you
			- N: is there something you want nox to do?  Not many would give without expectation
			- BV: you know many selfish people.  My offer is free of repayment.  Something something adn I will offer you more boons
			- N: I had a dream of a being who wanted one thing.  was that you?
			- BV: that was me. I still remember your promise to me.  I do not call upon it now.  I give this to you freely
			- N: you helped nox in ways he could never imagine.  I would be dead.  Of course I will help and accept. Nox is a simple goblin and almost died again
			- BV: have no fear, death has no hold on me and no hold on those i bestow my boons upon
			- N: do i need to (worship you)
			- BV: you will find they are made up beings the people of this land tell themselves to feel better. I can give you real power
			- N: youve already given so much. im not enough
			- BV: You are more than enough
			- *wakes up*

Morning

- Nirin has a bunch of papers all over his tent.  looks liek he went crazy
- Carved a new rune in his mechanical arm
- makes a new beast rune (raven?) using incense
- fox comes from the forest with twigs
- From the fire in his tent is born a raven, fox is gone, still abba
	- plays with pseudodragon
- nox wakes to colorful half-elf
	- does russian jig - ricktaio, the carnival master
	- N: need you to take down 2 notches
	- R: meet me in my room in the bluewater inn, plenty to tell you all
		- you all are in a mess and i am here to help
	- hops away and crashes...
- Kali talks to Klepto
	- Klepto shares that he appreciated the organization of the Ship made pins to help organize
	- ![[Arbiter Pin.png]]
	- ![[Captain Pin.png]]
- Nirin asks about chain shirt, identifies
	- its genuinely ordinary
	- Ireena puts it on, to beat his ass with his own gift
- Meetup
	- N: where is sanar
	- blah blah
	- N: you all going to be a mess today?
	- K: glad you brought that up.  *stabs pins into wall* we all come from different experiences.  When you grow up in Luskan, things get chaotic.  When i was young, was captured by criminal organization.  Pattern: success.  All have good ideas, we jsut contradict sometimes.  On a pirate ship, there are a couple roles to keep the rowdy aligned on the same page.  Arbiter only asks questions before ....  Asks the experts what plan should be.  That doesnt work during combat.  Need someone to make quick calls, cant be asking questions.  Thats where captain comes in. Parrot for arbiter, ship for captain.  I will throw my hat in for the arbiter.   Vote in, can be voted out.
	- all votes to Klepto for arbiter (except nox? 1:25:00)
	- N: found out martikovs are also running short on alcohol, family has tension and run alcohol. Also the colorful man wants to talk to us. Also people look at us funny
	- decide to seek the colorful man first
- in town
	- feels like powder keg, high tensions, even more flyers about the festival - tryin to compensate
	- clear that strategy is calm is not working.  A spark would ignite this fire
	- Stares and whispers regarding kletpo "Lady Watcher's prophecy is coming true..."
	- trepidation towards us.  Mystery, faced strahd, showed up when bad things happen.  Uncertainty in perception. not love not hate.
- guards being led by brutish individual, long arms, devilish looking arm, with extended fingers, coarse hair. Looks like really hairy human
	- looking for someone as they move along...
	- we barely stealth into alley
	- Nox gets peek bad, sees Izzak (spelling?)
		- He is shaken

Bluewater inn 

![[Bluewater Inn.png]]

- To get upstairs we can use outside stairs, can access
- Klepto asks for plan
	- we just going in since he wants to talk to us
- Head in, Ricktavio is juggling and such
	- K: where did you learn, 
	- R: all over
	- Ni: so you can leave...
	- R: idk (02:10:00)
	- R: I have to warn you... Carnie is a front for information gathering.  No one suspects a clown.  I want to offer some information... hoo hoo
	- D: why would you want to help us
	- R: outsiders, a little clueless, i thought i should offer
	- Ni: met other adventurers?
	- R: never met others. Vallaki is not a safe place.  You made waves, I wouldnt stick around.. whole town
		- Lady Fiona watcher in particular
	- K: what do you know of her
	- R: she is dangerous in her own way.  Only one willing to say the name of the devil
		- Nobility
	- No: you mean strahd?
	- R: SHHHHH
	- R: quote her "rather serve the devil than a madman (the baron)"
	- About the baron
		- R: idk, but outsiders are going to be pulled in directions
	- Ni: Kresk?
		- R: oh yes, abbot lives there, he raised someone fomr the dead last week!
	- K: wagon?
	- R: A large kitty, why were you snooping around the wagon?
	- Madmage to the north... probably north of the lake
		- he can help with those that go mad... being a clown
	- R: no show with the cat, its a bad kitty
	- Are you askign about the Tome of Strahd?
		- book might be helpful, found in barons house (he has a spy)
	- R: familiar with vistani, "watch out for them"
	- Klepto shares the fortune
	- R offers to show us the book
- As we walk, we see man with a wolf's head in gallows
- pulls out book, strahds raven symbol in front of a castle
	- he offers it to us, "I dont want this man's book"
	- barely visible dispelled glyph of warding
		- no longer active
	- feels like an attunable item
- Wizards of wine
	- go towards kresk, then crossroads, to the south
- Thieves Cant did not provoke anything from Ricktavio
- why watch out for vistani
	- they curse people and they are murderers
	- They always tend to go towards evil
	- Says strahd and vistani work together
	- Does not like when we use Strahd's name
- Kali and Ireena disguise 

The Tome of Strahd

- requires attunement
- no spells affect item, not created from spells
- magical memory book
- after attunement, aracana check to decode chapters strahd recorded of his past
- attune by spellcaster
- adv on skillcheck abotu barovia historyu of lore
- 4 hours to discipher new chapters, insight into barovia/strahd
- creature with prof in arcana can help
- reduces passive perception during the disiphering
- once attuned, if decode chapter, you get absorbed into the book as well as creatures within 30ft
- first chapter already decoded, so no need to 
- creatuer attuned died, time moves differently.  Single chapter takes one hour
	- while inside, insider strahds memories.
	- damage in chapter is sustained when you leave
	- death in chapter must be taken to the end of the chapter, or lost to pages of history
	- blend in each of these chapters, referred to by names, but your fit into the memory
	- events will be recorded as you go
		- people can read later to see what happneed
	- written events unfold as they did, but from strahds poitn of view


```
Rules of the Tome

Once the attuned creature has decided to investigate a chapter–if it is successfully decoded–they are forcefully absorbed into the pages of the book along with any other creature within 30 feet. 

The first chapter has already been decoded and will absorb the readers instantly when it is opened for the first time after it has been attuned to. 

If the creature attuned to the Tome dies, a creature friendly to them may attune to it and refer to their companion's shorthand to resume the translation. 

Time moves differently inside the pages of the Tome. Exploring a single chapter takes 1 hour of time in addition to the 4 hours spent on research and deciphering the text. 

While inside of the Tome, doors not connected to rooms relevant to the current events open to the Mists of Ravenloft. 

Any damage taken while in a chapter is sustained when a creature leaves. If a creature dies within the chapter, their body must be carried to the end of the chapter's events or it is lost to the pages of history. 

Any creatures exploring the chapters are referred to by their names, but illusory visages relevant to the events in that chapter mask their appearance so that they blend in. These illusions cannot be dispelled. 

Events are recorded on the pages as they occur. The attuned creature–and any creatures friendly to them–may read the documented events again but cannot re-enter a previously decoded chapter. 

The written version of the events unfold precisely as they occurred in the adventure but are written from Strahd’s perspective. Although creatures exploring the memories are referred to by name, their names are altered in the written version of the events that reflect the true moment. This way, any choices made in “the past” are always the correct version of history.
