## Death House Basement

We explored the various bedrooms in the basement of the [[Death House]] to find some various loot:

- Silver Shortsword
- Black book with victim log
- Gems
- Gold pouch
- Eyepatch
- Skin bag (was left in place)

After a Short Rest, we continued on led by [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] who discovered a Spike Trap with his body.  After assisting Nirin from the pit, we jumped across and found a locked door with no keyhole, yet had scratches around where a keyhole would be.  

We decided to explore the remainder of the area and came to a room with a statue holding an orb, where we use Detect Magic to investigate the area.  On the floor were shadows that moaned, "Don't look at us!  Leave this place!" while the orb chanted, "He is ancient!  He is the Land", possibly referencing [[Strahd von Zarovich]].  [[Klepto]] in particular was drawn to the orb, but he resisted the urge to touch it.

Moving forward, we discovered a Door Mimic and [[Durst Family|Ms. Durst]] who took the form of some kind of Eldritch Horror, all while more shadows attacked us.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] went to interact with [[Durst Family|Ms. Durst]], leaving [[Sanar]] to be killed by the Mimic.  After a brief conversation, [[Durst Family|Mrs Durst]] gave us a key to the keyless door and encouraged us to descend further to kill [[Durst Family|Walter]] with one request, "Tell Walter, 'Fuck you!' when you get down there."

[[Sanar|Sanar's]] soul departed his body and ascended above the [[Death House]] where he met the [[King Maker]] - a woman sitting upon a throne surrounded by riches.  She informed [[Sanar]] that the mists prevented his soul from leaving this place, but she could return his soul to his body unconditionally. She said to view it as a token of her good will towards him and the others, and she wanted to see [[Sanar]] fulfill his destiny.  [[Sanar]] accepted the offer, but the rest of the party was unaware of his death entirely.  After rejoining his body, [[Sanar]] noticed a near-invisible white symbol of a basic five-pointed crown on his arm.

## Walters Lair

Finishing off the remaining enemies and regrouping with a revived [[Sanar]], we make our way to the keyless door which Mrs. Durst's key opens with ease.  At the bottom of the stairs we find a room full of trinkets of sorts: daggers, shrunken heads, shriveled goblin hands, miniature mummies, etc.  The chanting at this point was clear to us and it continued the chant of the orb: "He is the Ancient!  He is the Land."  We left the room alone and made our way to the next.

The final room was filled with water up to our waists, with a structure along the sides to stand on, and a pedestal in the middle. Upon the pedestal was a white baby's blanket - potentially owned by [[Durst Family|Walter]] - and a Bloody Dagger which seemed cursed.  As we entered, Shadows phased through the walls and began a chant of their own, "One must die!  One must die!"  Turning to leave, a Refuse Pile came alive in the corner of the room and attacked us.  The Shadows remained passive and eventually left the room.  In the battle, [[Klepto]] was eaten by the Pile and within he found the "heart" of the beast was a baby wailing ([[Durst Family|Walter]]).  [[Klepto]] reached out and cast Shocking Grasp to murder a baby, and the Pile fell.  

On our way out, [[Klepto]] grabbed the Bloody Dagger, [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] grabbed a Bone Dagger and a Rat Skull Dagger, and [[Nox Vita|Nox]] grabbed a Shriveled Goblin Hand.  The Bloody Dagger was used for cursed sacrifices in the basement and when grabbed it restored [[Klepto]]'s' spells and enabled him to do so subtly, as if it wanted to be picked up.  [[Nox Vita|Nox]] lay the family to rest in the Crypts we found in [[Session 02#Navigating the Death House]].  

## Collapsing Death House

Once the bodies were laid to rest, the [[Death House|House]] began to collapse and we all rushed to escape.  Images of Giant Spiders racing towards us and collapsing debris filled our minds and we barely escaped, but we made it out with little more than minor injuries.

Outside the [[Death House|House]] we found another basket filled with Healing Potions, and a note from [[Strahd von Zarovich]] stating that he is "looking forward to meeting with us."  The Mist pushed us to the West and as we made our way, we came to the giant headless statues of the [[Barovia Village#Gates of Barovia|Gates of Barovia]]
