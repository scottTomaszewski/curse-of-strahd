# Session 5

## Waking at the [[Burgomaster Manor]]

We all wake up at the [[Burgomaster Manor]] after sharing the same dream (see [[Session 4#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor]]). [[Kali Rouge|Kali]], [[Nox Vita|Nox]], and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] all have a lovely sleep as a result of eating the pie the day before.  Kali opened her [[Kali Rouge#Dream Book|Dream Book]] to find no description of the dream, only positive adjectives.  The peaceful sleep led [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] to rush out of the house early to acquire more pies only to find [[Morgantha]] had left already.  Instead, [[Eric]] told him that she left behind a few pies for purchase.  Without any money, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] tricked [[Eric]] into putting the pies on another's tab. [[Nox Vita|Nox]] and [[Sanar]] woke and Nox made an attempt to engage with his [[Nox Vita#Box]].

Upon his return, [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] shares some pie with a skeptical [[Sanar]] and the group converses over [[Vampirism#Lore]] and [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] shares that she is not showing any traits.  Additionally, [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] shared lore on the [[Morning Lord]] and [[Mother Night]] (see [[Morning Lord#Features]] and [[Mother Night#Features]]) and expressed that they feel that both have forsaken the people of [[Barovia]] and their prayers have gone unanswered - not much has happened in their lifetime.

The group agrees to attend the funeral of [[Kolyan Indirovich]] and then make their way towards the [[Vistani]] settlement (the [[Tser Pool]]).

## Funeral for [[Kolyan Indirovich]]

Everyone went to the funeral for [[Kolyan Indirovich]] except [[Sanar]] and [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] who continued training [[Ireena Kolyanovich]].  During this training, [[Sanar]] agreed to be Ireena's target, but charmed her to attack [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] instead.

Before the ceremony, [[Nox Vita|Nox]] detected an undead presence who appeared as a male figure thought to be [[Strahd von Zarovich]].  The figure stood in the distance and looked to be paying his respects.  During the funeral, there were multiple readers and the people seemed to respond in a monotone chant.  

Afterwards, a carriage pulled up to the area and [[Lord Rahadin]] the Chamberlain of Strahd exited.  After a brief conversation, he gave [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] the [[Condolence Letter for Ireena]] which we agreed to not give to [[Ireena Kolyanovich]].  [[Lord Rahadin]] departed, but not before taking a [[Nirin Eze#Sprig of Lavender]] from [[Nox Vita|Nox]] who received it from [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]].

Before returning to the [[Burgomaster Manor]], [[Father Donovich]] advised use to send [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] to [[Krezk]] to the [[Abbot]] in the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] to perform "odd miracles" (a potential resolution to her bites?)

## Regroup at the [[Burgomaster Manor]]

We are reconvened at the [[Burgomaster Manor]] and shared our findings.  [[Nirin Eze|Nirin]] revealed the [[Nirin Eze#Sprig of Lavender]] had Scrying capabilities and snooped on [[Lord Rahadin]] and [[Strahd von Zarovich]].  They suspect [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] to be a vampire and notice that [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] and [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] are identical except for hair color. They also state they will be keeping an eye on us.

We depart for the bridge to [[Retrieve Leather Bundle for Bill Draur]] with [[Ireena Kolyanovich]]. 

## Battle for the Leather Bundle

As we walked down the river, [[Demetri Bebanburg|Demetri]] spotted a leather bundle on the other side of the river.  Although potentially faster to cross were we were, we decided it was safest to walk back to the bridge and cross safely.  When approaching the bundle, several **Ankheg** who immediately attacked us.  After defeating the defenders, we snatched the sealed leather bundle which was found along side bones of 4 humanoids, a small purse (3pg, 6sp, 21cp), a wizards spell book, straw from a scarecrow, and a rusty Greatsword.

As we returned to [[Barovia Village]], [[Sanar]] convinced the group to open the satchel and [[Kali Rouge|Kali]] did so after [[Ireena Kolyanovich]] claimed [[Bill Draur]] to be "an ass, his shop has nothing worth it, but this bag could be just as worthless."  Within the pack was approximately 4 Explorers Packs.  

When we arrived in the [[Barovia Village|village]], we made our way to [[Bill Draur's Mercantile]] to return the satchel where [[Bill Draur]] gave us a 20gp discount, but it meant nothing as he increased the price of a Shield for [[Nox Vita|Nox]] to 35gp!  After agreeing to purchase the Shield for 15gp, we started heading for the [[Tser Pool]].
