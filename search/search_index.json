This battle was foreshadowed by the East and West being blocked off by both the Zhentarim and Bloodswords. This included trade being cut off by the coast and Zhentarim sightings becoming more and more common in Sundabar. Ultimately, the attack invoked fear against the Drow, and all across Faerun, propaganda was propagated against them. This heightened fear pushed Silverymoon, and other countries, to take action against Drow cities in the Underdark. Though the war hasn\u2019t been long, the casualties have been high, and the pain still lingers. Chronology \u00b6 Warning Signs \u00b6 Though the invasion was sudden, there were many warning signs that signaled an incoming attack. One of the first signs that a planned attack was about to occur was the expansion of enemy groups on all sides. The Bloodswords, a group of thieves and bandits, cut off trade caravans from going to the coast. This stopped Silverymoon from making profits off of their magical wares and spells. In addition, the Zhentarim, a prominent ally of the Bloodswords, expanded its reach in all directions. There were reported sightings as far north as the Ten Towns and as far east as Sundabar. The second sign was an increase in the Drow population throughout the year. Silverymoon received a significant influx of Drow the year of the attack. Even the local Moonmistress, Phyrra Helfina, predicted this event during her Moon Reading the morning before, \u201cI sense something. A predator hiding from the prey. The prey is surrounded but knows not.\u201d Reports say she was very troubled by this telling, and she cut the session early. Storm of Ash \u00b6 The Storm of Ash was a magical storm created by Caelynn Hlaund, a powerful Cleric of Lolth, to protect the Drow from the sun. Once captured, Hlaund revealed this spell was inspired by a \u201cdevil up north.\u201d Many have speculated this to be related to Auril\u2019s Everlasting Rime in Icewind Dale. This powerful spell made being above the surface even possible for the Drow during the attack, and it managed to bypass the Mythal. It laid a thick coat of ash on the streets of Silverymoon and made it hard for civilians and soldiers to run throughout the streets. Stories from the event say attackers easily slid through it like water and were unimpeded by the ash. Betrayal \u00b6 Another defining turning point in this invasion was the betrayal of Jaeger Wolfgang. Wolfgang was an old member of the Lunae Lumen, a group of adventurers that specialize in collecting powerful magic items, and he often clashed with other members of his group. From testimonies of his ex-Lunae Lumen, \u201cJaeger always wanted to \u2018go back to the old days.\u2019\u201d Ever since Lunae Lumen focused their works in Silverymoon, Jaeger has wanted to pursue his greed elsewhere. He struck a deal with the Zhentarim, and with his access to politicians, located the Mythal, and handed it over to the Zhentarim. Taking the Mythal from its home deactivated the shield around Silverymoon, and allowed the Drow to enter. Targets \u00b6 The main objective of the invasion was not to take over Silverymoon. Instead, it was to obtain the Mythal and possibly take over Silverymoon. Therefore, soldiers were instructed to target popular landmarks and places of significance in order to stretch out the forces. The first of these landmarks to go was the Silverglen. A massive tree once stood in the place of worship but was burned down once they attacked. Other significant places of worship were destroyed at the beginning of the invasion. Once important places were destroyed, soldiers were commanded to specifically attack civilians. Some believe this was to either weaken the stability of the city if they were to overtake it or weaken the morale of the remaining soldiers. Either way, this tactic pulled the remaining soldiers away from the castle and allowed Drow to set up fortifications around it. Fortifying the castle made the Drow have a strong defense against soldiers if they were to try and take it back. Infiltration of Castle Silvermoon \u00b6 From the recounting of the Lunae Lumen, the most pivotal point of the invasion was their infiltration of Castle Silvermoon. Once the Drow had secured their station at Castle Silvermoon, their only weakness was the backdoor they came through. That backdoor being the newly created sewers under the city. As the group snuck through the castle, killing patrolling Drow, they claimed to have found the throne room of High Mage Methrammar Aerasum\u00e9. Behind the throne was an apparent portal to a demi-plane. Although the chances are unlikely, the Lunae Lumen claims to have traveled to Sel\u00fbne (the moon of Toril) due to the change of gravity and a view of Toril from space. What ensued in the demi-plane is purely speculation, and there are no other witnesses except for the Lunae Lumen. According to the group, there was a large ruined building of stone in the plane. Iconography of the moon and gods were inscribed into stone, and a large symbol of Sel\u00fbne was carved on the floor of the temple. After investigating for some time, the group was attacked by a being made of several revolving rings and a fetus at the center of the rings. Stabbed through the center of the fetus was the Mythal. After a gruesome battle with the creature, Lunae Lumen retrieved the Mythal and returned to Silverymoon. Aftermath \u00b6 After the Mythal was recovered, most of the Drow began to flee the city. With their mission failed and supposed leader dead, they had no reason to stay. Many of the Drow were captured while fleeing, and many of the POWs were publicly executed or used to gather information. Eventually, wizards and workers from all over Faerun came to help rebuild the broken city. But, these sins are not so easily forgiven. With the support of other cities over the Silver Marches, Silverymoon marched into the Underdark to attempt to fight against the encroaching Drow. This war is, by all means, not new. Thousands of these skirmishes have happened before. But with the amount of death from this previous attack, a wave of new anger is brewing within the people of Silverymoon.","title":"Storm of Ash"},{"location":"Events/Storm%20of%20Ash/#storm-of-ash","text":"Belligerent Silverymoon Church of Lolth Symbol Commanders and Leaders High Mage Methrammar Aerasum\u00e9, Mithras of Lunae Lumen, Sernius Alathar, Finneas Bottlebottom Manshoon Bullic The Scorned, Belgos Xiltyn, Caelynn Hlaund Units Involved Lunae Lumen, Knights in Silver, Spellguard, Silverwatch, Moon Garrison Aranea Mater (Church of Lolth), Stalwart (Zhentarim), Shadowblades (Church of Lolth), Insectum (Church of Lolth), Drow Infantry (Church of Lolth) Casualties 5462 2119 The Storm of Ash was the bloody invasion of Silverymoon that took place during Kythorn, 1490 D.R.

After assisting Nirin from the pit, we jumped across and found a locked door with no keyhole, yet had scratches around where a keyhole would be. We decided to explore the remainder of the area and came to a room with a statue holding an orb, where we use Detect Magic to investigate the area. On the floor were shadows that moaned, \"Don't look at us! Leave this place!\" while the orb chanted, \"He is ancient! He is the Land\", possibly referencing Strahd von Zarovich . Klepto in particular was drawn to the orb, but he resisted the urge to touch it. Moving forward, we discovered a Door Mimic and Ms. Durst who took the form of some kind of Eldritch Horror, all while more shadows attacked us. Nirin went to interact with Ms. Durst , leaving Sanar to be killed by the Mimic. After a brief conversation, Mrs Durst gave us a key to the keyless door and encouraged us to descend further to kill Walter with one request, \"Tell Walter, 'Fuck you!' when you get down there.\" Sanar's soul departed his body and ascended above the Death House where he met the King Maker - a woman sitting upon a throne surrounded by riches. She informed Sanar that the mists prevented his soul from leaving this place, but she could return his soul to his body unconditionally. She said to view it as a token of her good will towards him and the others, and she wanted to see Sanar fulfill his destiny. Sanar accepted the offer, but the rest of the party was unaware of his death entirely. After rejoining his body, Sanar noticed a near-invisible white symbol of a basic five-pointed crown on his arm. Walters Lair \u00b6 Finishing off the remaining enemies and regrouping with a revived Sanar , we make our way to the keyless door which Mrs. Durst's key opens with ease. At the bottom of the stairs we find a room full of trinkets of sorts: daggers, shrunken heads, shriveled goblin hands, miniature mummies, etc. The chanting at this point was clear to us and it continued the chant of the orb: \"He is the Ancient! He is the Land.\" We left the room alone and made our way to the next. The final room was filled with water up to our waists, with a structure along the sides to stand on, and a pedestal in the middle. Upon the pedestal was a white baby's blanket - potentially owned by Walter - and a Bloody Dagger which seemed cursed. As we entered, Shadows phased through the walls and began a chant of their own, \"One must die! One must die!\" Turning to leave, a Refuse Pile came alive in the corner of the room and attacked us. The Shadows remained passive and eventually left the room. In the battle, Klepto was eaten by the Pile and within he found the \"heart\" of the beast was a baby wailing ( Walter ). Klepto reached out and cast Shocking Grasp to murder a baby, and the Pile fell. On our way out, Klepto grabbed the Bloody Dagger, Kali grabbed a Bone Dagger and a Rat Skull Dagger, and Nox grabbed a Shriveled Goblin Hand.

We traveled for about an hour and came across an \"unkindness\" of Ravens were seen perched in a tree. As we passed, Ireena Kolyanovich put two fingers to her heart and bowed her head telling us that ravens represent good luck and to kill one is said to bring on bad luck - the origin may be related to the Mother Night . When asked why the people hide it, Ireena said that recognition of the raven may be seen as treasonous against Strahd von Zarovich - but she wasn't entire sure of that. We eventually reach a the Crossroads the we saw in our dream in Session 04#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor . To our left was an empty gallows, to our right was 11 unmarked gravestones seemingly undisturbed for some time. The sign post pointing Northwest read \" Tser Pool \" and the hill slanted downwards. The post pointing Southwest read \"Ravenloft\" and \" Vallaki \" as the hill slanted upwards in that direction. Another post pointed East and was labeled \" Barovia .\" As we departed this injunction, we heard rope swinging in the wind and where once the gallows was empty, now hung a corpse (male, 55 years old, tattered clothing) to all of us, but Sanar saw his own corpse hanging there. Kali asked if Sanar had died before, but he said he hadn't - covering the encounter within the Session 03#Death House Basement . As we walked, Ireena Kolyanovich shared that most people in Barovia have a negative perspective on the Vistani , but she had little experience with them herself. Wolf Ambush \u00b6 We soon heard the sound of screaming out and the howls of wolves . Ireena Kolyanovich informed us there are two kinds of wolves in Barovia - the \"normal\" kind, and a much larger and more dangerous variant. Nirin led the charge and we came to a group of 4 horse-sized wolves fighting an unusual Zombie equipped with leather armor, a longsword, and eyes that were vibrant with life. As we approached, 4 more wolves leaped out of some nearby bushed and attacked our party. Nirin was downed twice, but Nox quickly brought him back into the fight. We downed the wolves while the Zombie took down his 4 himself. Ireena Kolyanovich even got the killing blow on one and Demetri 's Familiar put another to sleep. When Ireena Kolyanovich joined the fight, the wolves seemed to be extra cautious around her, careful not to step on her or harm her in any way. After the battle, we speak with the Zombie who introduces himself as Sir Gaheris de Karaheu of the Order of the Silver Dragon . He stated his purpose was to hunt the agents of Strahd von Zarovich , that he doesn't like Strahd. He did warn however that we should not interfere with Strahd's leadership in any way - he must suffer the consequences of what he had brought about. Before departing abruptly, Nox asked how he was \"undead, but not dead\" to which he responded, \"Vengeance keeps me alive.\" Before moving on, Klepto examined his new turret bot and Sanar took the opportunity to show solidarity by asking if it was sentient. With Klepto unsure, Sanar attempted to communicate with the bot telepathically. The turret immediately yelled out, \"GIVE ME BACK MY HAND!\" Sanar responded, \"Whose hand? Who are you?\" The turret returned, \"YOU STOLE MY SWORD, WHEN I FIND YOU I WILL RIP YOU INTO PIECES!\" and Sanar ended the telepathy and told Klepto that they have much to discuss in the future. Tser Pool Vistani Encampment \u00b6 As we made our way along, we eventually see the tracks of wagons and we reach the Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment with 8 horses, wagons, and the group of Vistani we were seeking. We are immediately welcomed in by Stanamir who hugs us and joyously gives us wine to drink. Ireena Kolyanovich looks tense, but she tries to break from the fearful traditions of her brother and father . We ask Stanamir some questions: Why can the Vistani leave, but others cant? Maybe because the Vistani saved the prince (from the story told in Session 01 ) The Vistani and Strahd von Zarovich have a mutual respect If the Vistani dont break Strahd von Zarovich 's rules, then they are free to come and go Clarified that the Vistani are not servants of Strahd, but he is not surprised that others think they are allies Asked about the Order of the Silver Dragon Stanamir knows little of the Order of the Silver Dragon , but he does see them occasionally The Vistani and the Order of the Silver Dragon mutually don't mess with each other When asked about Kali being smuggled out of Barovia , Stanamir said that he was not involved with that. It was a small Vistani family who had been removed, to be Ex Vistani . That family has been dealt with, likely by Strahd von Zarovich . He also clarified that there are some Vistani that wander freely, and these are not Ex Vistani . Madam Eva tells our Fortunes \u00b6 We venture into Madam Eva 's tent with Ireena Kolyanovich where we find a crystal ball on a table surrounded by pillows for sitting and a chair sat on by Madam Eva . We each placed the cards we previously received down before us and power coursed through Madam Eva 's veins as she held the Tarokka Deck . Madam Eva drew three cards from the Tarokka Deck#Common Deck and two from the Tarokka Deck#High Cards . She then drew 1 card for each of us from the Tarokka Deck#High Cards and said, \" The threads of fate have spoken to me...\" Madam Eva first revealed the center cards revealing the future of our group: Knowledge of the Past \u00b6 Common Card 1 - 9 of Glyphs This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy. A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek. Holy Symbol \u00b6 Common Card 2 - 8 of Glyphs This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope. The treasure lies in a dragon\u2019s house, in hands once clean and now corrupted. Sword of Sunlight \u00b6 Common Card 3 - 5 of Stars This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight. What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors. Your Ally \u00b6 High Card 1 - DonJon This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness. Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong. Strahd's Location \u00b6 High Card 2 - Seer This is the location of Strahd von Zarovich (when you want to find him) Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him! He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all. Personal Readings \u00b6 Madam Eva then revealed and interpreted the cards for each of us. Character Given Card (Common Card) Drawn Card (High Card) Demetri Bebanburg Necromancer Artifact Kali Rouge Avenger Broken One Klepto Rogue Executioner Nirin Eze Illusionist Tempter Nox Vita Anarchist Ghost Sanar Enchanter Beast We asked Madam Eva why she was helping and she said, \"My Inner eye told me you were coming and I was to help.\" She is known to Nox as \"The Veiled Lady\" when asking if she was a deity. She told him she was just a fortune teller, \"What I was previously is of no consequence.\" and that the gods would not help and Nox must find his own path. Klepto asked if the Execution was his own and Madam Eva responded that, \"the threads of fate can combine past, present and future. What will it be? That is your choice...\" We also found out that although the Vistani travel, Madam Eva remains and finds joy in helping champions. As for Strahd von Zarovich , she said her will didn't matter, but we were instructed to \"follow the cards and their fate. We may escape and bring a better life to those in Barovia .\" Madam Eva refused to do a reading for Ireena Kolyanovich , but she was capable of doing so. When asked about the King Maker by Sanar , Madam Eva told him that if he desires power and success, the King Maker will grant it, but if asking for understanding, she cannot give him that. For understanding, he can seek out the Mountainfolk where a Shaman may be able to help him ( Seek out the Mountainfolk ), but Madam Eva does not know the cost of doing so. Contemplating our Fortunes \u00b6 We all left the tent in series. Nirin immediately grabbed a jug of wine and traveled down river to sit by a tree. From a compartment in his arm, he removed a small piece of rope with a loop on the end, then broke down to cry with his mechanical fox nearby. Stanamir asks how our travels were and claims that he was not responsible for the way we made it here. Kali recounted a brief rendition of the events and Stanamir seemed disappointed in the lack of details. A heavily intoxicated Nox told Stanamir the story of the Darkest Night - when Silverymoon was attacked by Dark Elves and \"Spider Fuckers.\" Some of his companions died in the event and Nox said they \"deserved everything that came to them\", but the story trailed off as Nox had a Reversal of Fortune and Klepto assisted him to bed. Stanamir then spit into the fire and a Green Flame displayed the story that he began to tell. 4-5 years ago there was a mighty and renowned Wizard (name forgotten) holding a book - a charismatic leader wearing a black robe and wielding a powerful staff who even created his own spells. The Wizard had several companions - a Bugbear, Warrior, and an Archer. He roused the people of Barovia Village against Strahd von Zarovich in Castle Ravenloft . When they approached, many fled in terror despite Strahd von Zarovich appearing unarmed and unarmored. Those that stayed got on their knees and groveled before him, others stood and died outright. The Wizard fought Strahd von Zarovich all over the land, taking hits, but remaining in the fight. Eventually Strahd von Zarovich overtook him and threw his body over a cliff into the Tser Pool , but Stanamir was unable to find his body - the river must have washed it away... We asked Stanamir if his fortune was ever told and came true by Madam Eva and he said \"yes, in a way...\" as he looked on to his family nearby. Once Klepto finished putting the wasted Nox to bed, he was approached by a Vistani woman named Eliza who said it was good to have outsiders and asked if we were here to take back Castle Ravenloft . Klepto said he was looking for a Vistani named Esmeralda . Eliza did not know her, but Barovia is the best place to look. After mentioning we were heading to Vallaki , Eliza asked us to get a Name-day gift for Arabelle . Eliza made an antidote and shoved it down Nox's throat to help him feel better. Kali had a small chat with Ireena Kolyanovich , agreed to head to Vallaki , then went off to search for Nirin . They found him against a tree, miserable, and encouraged him to return to the Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment for the night. While grabbing some tobacco and booze for Nirin on the way back, Kali noticed a Vistani woman tying a note to a Magpie (black bird) and sending it off.

We traveled for about an hour and came across an \"unkindness\" of Ravens were seen perched in a tree. As we passed, Ireena Kolyanovich put two fingers to her heart and bowed her head telling us that ravens represent good luck and to kill one is said to bring on bad luck - the origin may be related to the Mother Night . When asked why the people hide it, Ireena said that recognition of the raven may be seen as treasonous against Strahd von Zarovich - but she wasn't entire sure of that. We eventually reach a the Crossroads the we saw in our dream in Session 04#Rest at the Burgomaster Manor . To our left was an empty gallows, to our right was 11 unmarked gravestones seemingly undisturbed for some time. The sign post pointing Northwest read \" Tser Pool \" and the hill slanted downwards. The post pointing Southwest read \"Ravenloft\" and \" Vallaki \" as the hill slanted upwards in that direction. Another post pointed East and was labeled \" Barovia .\" As we departed this injunction, we heard rope swinging in the wind and where once the gallows was empty, now hung a corpse (male, 55 years old, tattered clothing) to all of us, but Sanar saw his own corpse hanging there. Kali asked if Sanar had died before, but he said he hadn't - covering the encounter within the Session 03#Death House Basement . As we walked, Ireena Kolyanovich shared that most people in Barovia have a negative perspective on the Vistani , but she had little experience with them herself.","title":"Walking to the Tser Pool"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2006/#wolf-ambush","text":"We soon heard the sound of screaming out and the howls of wolves . Ireena Kolyanovich informed us there are two kinds of wolves in Barovia - the \"normal\" kind, and a much larger and more dangerous variant. Nirin led the charge and we came to a group of 4 horse-sized wolves fighting an unusual Zombie equipped with leather armor, a longsword, and eyes that were vibrant with life. As we approached, 4 more wolves leaped out of some nearby bushed and attacked our party. Nirin was downed twice, but Nox quickly brought him back into the fight. We downed the wolves while the Zombie took down his 4 himself. Ireena Kolyanovich even got the killing blow on one and Demetri 's Familiar put another to sleep. When Ireena Kolyanovich joined the fight, the wolves seemed to be extra cautious around her, careful not to step on her or harm her in any way. After the battle, we speak with the Zombie who introduces himself as Sir Gaheris de Karaheu of the Order of the Silver Dragon . He stated his purpose was to hunt the agents of Strahd von Zarovich , that he doesn't like Strahd. He did warn however that we should not interfere with Strahd's leadership in any way - he must suffer the consequences of what he had brought about. Before departing abruptly, Nox asked how he was \"undead, but not dead\" to which he responded, \"Vengeance keeps me alive.\" Before moving on, Klepto examined his new turret bot and Sanar took the opportunity to show solidarity by asking if it was sentient. With Klepto unsure, Sanar attempted to communicate with the bot telepathically. The turret immediately yelled out, \"GIVE ME BACK MY HAND!\" Sanar responded, \"Whose hand? Who are you?\" The turret returned, \"YOU STOLE MY SWORD, WHEN I FIND YOU I WILL RIP YOU INTO PIECES!\" and Sanar ended the telepathy and told Klepto that they have much to discuss in the future.","title":"Wolf Ambush"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2006/#tser-pool-vistani-encampment","text":"As we made our way along, we eventually see the tracks of wagons and we reach the Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment with 8 horses, wagons, and the group of Vistani we were seeking.

Ireena Kolyanovich looks tense, but she tries to break from the fearful traditions of her brother and father . We ask Stanamir some questions: Why can the Vistani leave, but others cant? Maybe because the Vistani saved the prince (from the story told in Session 01 ) The Vistani and Strahd von Zarovich have a mutual respect If the Vistani dont break Strahd von Zarovich 's rules, then they are free to come and go Clarified that the Vistani are not servants of Strahd, but he is not surprised that others think they are allies Asked about the Order of the Silver Dragon Stanamir knows little of the Order of the Silver Dragon , but he does see them occasionally The Vistani and the Order of the Silver Dragon mutually don't mess with each other When asked about Kali being smuggled out of Barovia , Stanamir said that he was not involved with that. It was a small Vistani family who had been removed, to be Ex Vistani . That family has been dealt with, likely by Strahd von Zarovich .

As Nirin sat by the fire quietly, Nox attempted a ritual similar to before (See Session 05#Waking at the Burgomaster Manor ) with a severe hangover and failed. Sanar wakes contemplating the fortunes told the night before and examines the Spell Book acquired from the Ankheg nests , finding it mostly illegible save for Find Familiar , Alarm , and Detect Magic . Ireena Kolyanovich wakes with sore feet from the extensive travels, but Nirin encourages her, then he converses with Klepto about their commonalities in tinkering: Nirin with his Nirin Eze#Arm claiming he didn't make it, and Klepto with his Klepto#Eldritch Cannon . Klepto asked Stanamir if there were merchants in the Tser Pool#Vistani Encampment , was told \"no\", but was told there were some at the Vallaki Vistani Encampment . When asked about the haunted gallows from Session 06#Walking to the Tser Pool , Stanamir said he's never seen any bodies hung from them before. Sanar reassured Nox that although he may be a Drow , he is not a follower of Lolth and was not at Silverymoon during the Storm of Ash , although Nox did not remember the story he told the night before during Session 06#Contemplating our Fortunes , but confirmed to Sanar that he knows that Sanar would never do such a thing. Moving focus to Demetri , Sanar asked him if he was being truthful about his Vampiric heritage since his Session 06#Personal Readings seemed to indicate there was an ancestry of the trait. Demetri confirmed that he is still unsure of the origin of his transformation nor did his family share any information with him. When Sanar was asked why he wanted to speak with Madam Eva alone, he shared that he crossed paths with the King Maker and was curious about the implications. We agreed to remain a group for the time being since our paths seem to align. Speaking with Stanamir \u00b6 Nirin took Stanamir aside and asked him about the symbol found on his Nirin Eze#Arm . Stanamir thought the symbol reminded him of the deity Tyr, but typically the scales rest on a Warhammer and there isn't an angel nor devil. Stanamir casts Detect Magic on the symbol and sees that its magical in nature, but is unable to pinpoint the School of magic - possibly conjuration or illusion. He suggests Nirin focus on it, touch it, etc. Demetri joined the conversation and asked Stanamir what was happening to him. Stanamir observed that Demetri may be a Vampirism#Dhampir as he seems similar to ones he's seen in other realms. Oddly, that would require being bitten from Stanamir's knowledge, but Demetri doesn't recall those events. When finished getting ready, Nox also joins the conversation and asks Stanamir about the Shriveled Goblin Hand he found in the Death House ( Session 03#Walters Lair ), but Stanamir finds it ordinary. Stanamir gives us some basic directions and we depart. Journey to the Svalich Road Bridge \u00b6 We travel for a few hours along the Svalich Woods#Road and come to a waterfall with a Svalich Woods#Bridge and Waterfall 1000ft above. Instead of climbing, we choose to walk the path and as we approach the bridge we notice Dark Gargoyles decorating it. Using his Proto-Dragon Familiar as a scout, Demetri notices several bodies on the other side of the bridge. We approach and find footprints leading to and from the bodies, into the woods, and one set that seem to leave the area. After our investigation, we conclude that a barefoot vampire drained the blood of the victims and slashed the throats of another set of bodies in the woods. Kali made a sketch of the barefoot prints and pocketed some coin from the bodies which we determined to be of the raging mob we first encountered in Session 04#Traveling to the Blood on the Vine Tavern . Ireena tells us this is what happens to those that attempt to stand up to Strahd von Zarovich as Nox gives them their last rites in the name of the Morning Lord . In discussing the implications of this, Demetri and Sanar posture that Strahd von Zarovich is testing us - that he could easily overpower the party and take Ireena if he wanted, but for some reason he chooses not to. Ireena notes that the footprints may not be of Strahd von Zarovich himself, but other Vampires under Strahd's command . Sanar asks if Lord Rahadin is also a vampire , but Ireena doubts it. Before progressing, the morning's travels bring on the reminder of the delicious Dream Pie eaten previously: Kali and Nox have cravings, but fight them off. Nirin on the other hand cannot resist and is consumed by the desire for Dream Pie (disadvantage). On the rest of the journey he repeatedly runs ahead, then waits for everyone to catch up, eager to get his hands on more Dream Pie in Vallaki . Travel to the Western Gates \u00b6 Leaving the bodies behind, we continue our travels down the Svalich Woods#Road . Nox asked about the story he told the night before ( Session 06#Contemplating our Fortunes ) and Sanar filled in the details of the story shared of the Storm of Ash and the two confide in each other - Nox revealing more information about his previous party, Sodality . We come to a fork in the road with a signpost labeled Castle Ravenloft pointing East Has a once-nice cobblestone road Vallaki , Berez , and Krezk pointing West Ireena updates us that Berez is the fourth village that supposedly existed. Her rumor matched that of Morgantha saying that it was swallowed up by the flooded river hundreds of years ago. We head West towards Vallaki and as the sun continues to set as Nirin's Dream Pie craving continues. We approach two headless statues between large cliffs, exactly like the Barovia Village#Gates of Barovia where we prepare camp for the night. Night on Svalich Road \u00b6 Nirin and Demetri's Raven Familiar take the first watch and shorty see a shadowy figure step out from a tree. His eye's flash and Nirin displays trust and friendship in conversation. The figure introduces themselves as Strahd von Zarovich and asks about our purpose in the woods and for a Gold Piece. Nirin shares that we are traveling to Vallaki and although he doesn't have any Gold, he offers tobacco instead, which Strahd accepts. The two continue formalities and Strahd conveys that he wants to ensure safe travels and he wishes to help. Before disappearing into the night, he requests Nirin let Ireena know that he says \"Hello\". Breaking from the charm, Nirin reflects on what just happened and asks his Nirin Eze#Armband , \"What are you?\", but there is no response. \"Have I made a mistake?\", and the devil goes down (no). As a control, he asks if his name is \"Nirin\", the angel goes down (yes). \"Are you Tyr?\", angel drops (yes). Kali and Sanar take second watch, asking Nirin if there is anything to worry about, but he declines, then Kali sets up a telepathic connection with Nirin and Nox to find Nirin is having nightmares and weeps. Sanar asks Kali about her relationship with Klepto and she shares that the Klepto#Eldritch Cannon wasn't always with him. Sanar shares that the turret is sentient and doesn't seem to want to be under Klepto's control. When asked about his powers, Sanar tells her that he practiced them as a child under his father's watch and he assumes he inherited the powers from him. Kali shares that her powers are recent and came from an explosion. Kali asked Sanar about his views of Strahd and Sanar replies that after today's discovery , he definitely seems more evil than at first. Nox and Ireena take third watch as Ireena crafts with her Embroidery Kit and asks Nox about his hobbies. Nox says he doesn't really have many hobbies, he just helps people. Ireena shares that she wants to heal people with her Embroidery via magic or plants. Nox asks how Ireena is doing with the loss of her father , then goes off to attempt his ritual again, but fails. When we wake, Nox discovers he lost his Shriveled Goblin Hand (likely taken by Strahd during his ritual) and Nirin makes no mention of his encounter with Strahd the night before. Discovering the Windmill of Morgantha \u00b6 We continue our travels and come across a mossy tablet with a rough carving of a wolf's head. With Sanar noting it was thousands of years old, Kali made a quick sketch of it and we briefly discussed naming our group. Another hour into our walk, Old Svalich Road transitions into a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside and we descend into a valley. We come across a hill with a windmill on top - one that looks similar if not identical to the windmills we saw in the Death House . Seeing a small Twig Figurine on the ground, we detect the delicious smell of pie and Demetri sends his familiar to scout the area. Inside the windmill is Bella , an old woman with hair up in a mound and hands covered in dough who says, \"Look at you! What the fuck?!\" We enter the Windmill Bakery to find pastries being baked and more Twig Doll are in the corner of the room. Bella hollers for her sister, Ophalia and says that their mother Morgantha will be home soon. Complimenting the pies, we buy 3 more for 1gp each and get one for free and Bella says that she is \"happy that people appreciate their work: to make people in Barovia happy,\" but Sanar mentions that the people don't seem happy. Nirin immediately consumers one of the pies and Sanar questions how the people of Barovia can afford to pay 1gp per pie. Bella mentions there is wealth in the valley, even if they don't look it the people have money. Asking about the Twig Doll , Bella informs us that they make them themselves and are for \"decoration\" and we are led to believe her. Outside, Klepto notices many Ravens circling above. The Four Stone Square \u00b6 As we depart, we quickly visit the Windmill Bakery#Four Stone Square nearby which Bella says is the remnant from an old building. Morgantha joins us and states its a place of power, dark, requires sacrifice. We depart, and Nirin asks Granny if she knows anything about his Nirin Eze#Armband , but she says she doesn't. As he departs, the devil side of his Nirin Eze#Armband descends, \"No.\" Travel from the Windmill to Vallaki \u00b6 On our way to Vallaki we encounter a man on the road leading a Draft Horse who introduced himself as Arrigal , one of the leaders of the Vallaki Vistani Encampment . Arrigal was bring in supplies from outside Barovia and described Vallaki as a \"powder keg\" - everyone is tightly wound up and they are unfriendly towards the Vistani , with the exception of the Blue Water Inn . Arrigal mentioned [[Blinsky's Toys]] and Klepto asked what kind of toys Arabelle liked. Arrigal said they only have creepy toys. We also chatted about the protection of Church of St Andral and books in Vallaki . Arrigal suggested we check out \"Van Richten's Guide to Monster Slaying.\" When we asked about Strahd , Arrigal said he likes him, he treats the Vistani well, and doesn't care that he treats rest of people poorly, the people treat themselves poorly. Asking to stay in the Vallaki Vistani Encampment , Klepto shows Arrigal the note from Eliza which should help convince his brother Luvash to welcome the party. Arrigal also shared that the Vallaki Vistani Encampment is home to a Vallaki Vistani Encampment#Dusk Elf Encampment . Traveling to the Vallaki Vistani Encampment \u00b6 As we approach the Vallaki Gate we notice dozens of wolf heads on stakes - which are new according to Arrigal and he mentions that the guards can be dicks sometimes. After some discussion, the guards let Arrigal , the \"dirty vistani\", and the party go around without issue - the Gates are closed for the night and we head around towards the Vallaki Vistani Encampment . Arrigal mentions that Dusk Elves are not as disliked as Vistani , but they tend to not enter Vallaki - there is also a half Dusk Elf who owns the Vallaki#Tannery . When asked about the relationship between the Vistani and the others, Arrigal says the \"dislike goes both ways,\" but he \"just wants to look out for his own people.\" Entering the Vallaki Vistani Encampment \u00b6 We arrive at large encampment , full of covered wagons and the scent of wine and horses. Arrigal points to hovels built into the hills where the Vallaki Vistani Encampment#Dusk Elf Encampment is. We hear yelling from a brightly lit tent in the center of the camp where a bear of a man, Luvash was scolding a teenage boy, Alexei for losing his daughter Arabelle and rages that she \"never listens\". Luvash requests that we Return Arabelle to the Vistani Encampment and gives us Arabelle 's favorite bronze necklace to help her notice us","title":"Session 7"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2007/#session-7","text":"Youtube - Curse of Strahd Session 7","title":"Session 7"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2007/#waking-in-the-vistani-encampment","text":"As the sun rose on a new day, Nirin and Nox were early to rise.

Before progressing, the morning's travels bring on the reminder of the delicious Dream Pie eaten previously: Kali and Nox have cravings, but fight them off. Nirin on the other hand cannot resist and is consumed by the desire for Dream Pie (disadvantage). On the rest of the journey he repeatedly runs ahead, then waits for everyone to catch up, eager to get his hands on more Dream Pie in Vallaki .","title":"Journey to the Svalich Road Bridge"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2007/#travel-to-the-western-gates","text":"Leaving the bodies behind, we continue our travels down the Svalich Woods#Road . Nox asked about the story he told the night before ( Session 06#Contemplating our Fortunes ) and Sanar filled in the details of the story shared of the Storm of Ash and the two confide in each other - Nox revealing more information about his previous party, Sodality . We come to a fork in the road with a signpost labeled Castle Ravenloft pointing East Has a once-nice cobblestone road Vallaki , Berez , and Krezk pointing West Ireena updates us that Berez is the fourth village that supposedly existed. Her rumor matched that of Morgantha saying that it was swallowed up by the flooded river hundreds of years ago. We head West towards Vallaki and as the sun continues to set as Nirin's Dream Pie craving continues. We approach two headless statues between large cliffs, exactly like the Barovia Village#Gates of Barovia where we prepare camp for the night.","title":"Travel to the Western Gates"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2007/#night-on-svalich-road","text":"Nirin and Demetri's Raven Familiar take the first watch and shorty see a shadowy figure step out from a tree. His eye's flash and Nirin displays trust and friendship in conversation. The figure introduces themselves as Strahd von Zarovich and asks about our purpose in the woods and for a Gold Piece. Nirin shares that we are traveling to Vallaki and although he doesn't have any Gold, he offers tobacco instead, which Strahd accepts. The two continue formalities and Strahd conveys that he wants to ensure safe travels and he wishes to help. Before disappearing into the night, he requests Nirin let Ireena know that he says \"Hello\". Breaking from the charm, Nirin reflects on what just happened and asks his Nirin Eze#Armband , \"What are you?\", but there is no response. \"Have I made a mistake?\", and the devil goes down (no). As a control, he asks if his name is \"Nirin\", the angel goes down (yes). \"Are you Tyr?\", angel drops (yes). Kali and Sanar take second watch, asking Nirin if there is anything to worry about, but he declines, then Kali sets up a telepathic connection with Nirin and Nox to find Nirin is having nightmares and weeps. Sanar asks Kali about her relationship with Klepto and she shares that the Klepto#Eldritch Cannon wasn't always with him. Sanar shares that the turret is sentient and doesn't seem to want to be under Klepto's control. When asked about his powers, Sanar tells her that he practiced them as a child under his father's watch and he assumes he inherited the powers from him. Kali shares that her powers are recent and came from an explosion. Kali asked Sanar about his views of Strahd and Sanar replies that after today's discovery , he definitely seems more evil than at first. Nox and Ireena take third watch as Ireena crafts with her Embroidery Kit and asks Nox about his hobbies. Nox says he doesn't really have many hobbies, he just helps people. Ireena shares that she wants to heal people with her Embroidery via magic or plants. Nox asks how Ireena is doing with the loss of her father , then goes off to attempt his ritual again, but fails. When we wake, Nox discovers he lost his Shriveled Goblin Hand (likely taken by Strahd during his ritual) and Nirin makes no mention of his encounter with Strahd the night before.","title":"Night on Svalich Road"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2007/#discovering-the-windmill-of-morgantha","text":"We continue our travels and come across a mossy tablet with a rough carving of a wolf's head. With Sanar noting it was thousands of years old, Kali made a quick sketch of it and we briefly discussed naming our group. Another hour into our walk, Old Svalich Road transitions into a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside and we descend into a valley. We come across a hill with a windmill on top - one that looks similar if not identical to the windmills we saw in the Death House . Seeing a small Twig Figurine on the ground, we detect the delicious smell of pie and Demetri sends his familiar to scout the area. Inside the windmill is Bella , an old woman with hair up in a mound and hands covered in dough who says, \"Look at you! What the fuck?!\" We enter the Windmill Bakery to find pastries being baked and more Twig Doll are in the corner of the room. Bella hollers for her sister, Ophalia and says that their mother Morgantha will be home soon. Complimenting the pies, we buy 3 more for 1gp each and get one for free and Bella says that she is \"happy that people appreciate their work: to make people in Barovia happy,\" but Sanar mentions that the people don't seem happy. Nirin immediately consumers one of the pies and Sanar questions how the people of Barovia can afford to pay 1gp per pie. Bella mentions there is wealth in the valley, even if they don't look it the people have money. Asking about the Twig Doll , Bella informs us that they make them themselves and are for \"decoration\" and we are led to believe her.

Arrigal mentioned [[Blinsky's Toys]] and Klepto asked what kind of toys Arabelle liked. Arrigal said they only have creepy toys. We also chatted about the protection of Church of St Andral and books in Vallaki . Arrigal suggested we check out \"Van Richten's Guide to Monster Slaying.\" When we asked about Strahd , Arrigal said he likes him, he treats the Vistani well, and doesn't care that he treats rest of people poorly, the people treat themselves poorly. Asking to stay in the Vallaki Vistani Encampment , Klepto shows Arrigal the note from Eliza which should help convince his brother Luvash to welcome the party.

Sanar asked the guards why Dusk Elves and Vistani aren't allowed in and they said, \" Dusk Elves are allowed in, but they are a broken people; there's not many of them\" and \" Vistani are vagabonds, not to be trusted, and likely in league with Strahd .\" Blue Water Inn was suggested as a fine resting point for the night.

Luvash says no - then it seems as though some are born w/o souls Souls may be disappearing through hole in the mist? or something is consuming them? Kali asks if Pidlwick II has a soul Clear he doesn't as it is a construct While consider where to go next the party considers staying w/ the Vistani for the rest of the day Luvash states they wouldn't have enough wine to go around, they haven't gotten a delivery in some time [[Davian Martikov]] is their contact from the Wizard of Wine- same last name as [[Urwin Martikov]] Approaching Nox \u00b6 Party approaches Nox as he is talking to the rings on the end of the chain around his neck Seems to be talking to Amare, his friend from his previous group - Sodality Pidlwick II sneaks up on Nox , who seems to be extremely unsettled by it's presence Nox explains that the past day was really dark, and he is uncomfortable Nirin apologizes for things getting out of hand Nox knows attempting to kill a child is terrible, but [[Bluto]] was a husk Punishing him with death is no different than what he was going to do to Arabelle Everything is morally grey Nox asks if Nirin has a child He did, Nox says he was supposed to Nox doesn't want Pidlwick II to join them It seems to like Nirin , Klepto is roughly able to command it to do things Listens to Nirin to stay behind as Nox taunts it Sanar joins back up with the group and is seen itching his arm Nirin asks if he has learned anything, Sanar states he still has some processing to do Back to Valaki \u00b6 Different guards, confirm with our previous documentation, generally less of a hassle then last time As soon as we enter we see a small crowd of people, laughter and smiles, which seems weird Court jester in the center, colorful (but not Vistani colorful), performing a puppet show No apparent meaning to the story he is telling _[[Rictavio]]'s Carnival of Wonders Eventually we come across a church - [[Church of Saint Andral]] Stained windows depicting pious saints, gravestones behind wrought iron fence Decide to come back later, Ireena agrees Work our way towards the Market On the way we cross the town square, which appears to be the center of the town's festivals Center of square is statue of man facing west, platform around him holds gallows Nirin follows his line of sight, appears to be looking straight towards the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]]'s mansion Around gallows are some stocks, where some men, women and children wearing donkey heads are locked Shopping \u00b6 Potential shops Yanvich and Son's bookstore Dusklight Supply Shop Thindoles Smithing [[Blinkski's Toy Shop|Blinkski's toys]] Raven's eye tannery - a bit further off from the town square [[Blinkski's Toy Shop|Blinkski's Toys]] \u00b6 [[Blinkski's Toy Shop|Blinkski's Toys]] - Everyone but Sanar and Kali start here first Is no Fun, Is no [[Blinkski]] All of the toys seem slightly off, like dolls but missing an eye or mouth etc. [[Blinkski]] has monkey on his shoulder w/ a pink ballerina tutu (Piccolo) [[Blinkski]] shows Nox that he has a doll that looks exactly like him Apparently the head of the guard - Izek Strazni - requests a doll that looks exactly like Nox every single month Every month his description gets more and more accurate [[Blinkski]] Doesn't appear to know what a Goblin is Nirin asks about clockwork toys He doesn't have it, but [[Frtiz Von Weirg]] has a clockwork man somewhere in Valaki Later says Fritz is dead, but clockwork man is missing Toy for Arabelle Nirin finds a werewolf doll Klepto asks about a game for multiple children to play at once, as well as a disguise for a child Decides to buy both They ask about Piccolo, says a puppet man ([[Rictavio]]) gave him Piccolo as he seemed lonely Nox asks if [[Blinkski]] sells any hobbies Buys some cards to do magic tricks with as well as a knife 'fidget' spinner As they leave Nox brings up that the doll was really weird, especially weird that the head of the guard is asking for it Dusklight Supply Shop \u00b6 Sanar and Kali head here Sanar buys a climber's kit and a bag of ball bearings Kali buys some lanterns and caltrops Sanar is able to convince the shopkeeper to give them quite a large discount When he does his tattoo itches and some ghostly figure (The Kingmaker) appears to whisper in the shopkeepers ear, although no one sees this Thindole's Smithing \u00b6 Nirin buys a rapier Ireena asks to hold the rapier briefly, as she grabs it something comes over her, eyes gloss over, and she appears as if she suddenly knows how to wield it Nirin casts detect magic and nothing appears Ireena decides to buy her own Klepto buys some scale mail Nox buys some tiny scale mail and a hammer Nox notices dragon-like engravings along the hammer Klepto tries to steal a gem within one of the swords Kingmaker assists him in stealing the gem - a bloodstone Raven's Eye Tannery \u00b6 Sanar and Kali head towards east side of town towards Tannery On the way there we see a stockyard, a butcher, and possibly a mortuary Additionally see [[Rictavio]]'s wagon, colorful and seems to be the wagon we are searching for [[Fortune - Group - Knowledge of the Past]] Wagon has a padlock on it Kali reaches out to Klepto and tells him what we found, we'll wait for him and head to the tannery in the meantime Woman covered in scars, darkish skin, long curly back hair Kali buys leather armor Sanar recognizes her as a half-dusk elf, she also reveals she is half Vistani Other dusk elves look down upon her, as do Vistani and humans Sanar is confused as they Vistani and Dusk elves live together so they clearly like each other Vistani and dusk elves are family oriented, their ideal individual is not mixed with one another Her scars are from 3 oafs in Valaki Sanar offers to deal with them, but she doesn't wish to give him any information in case they he winds up in the Reformation center Reformation center - combination court house, barracks, prison and unofficially torture center People enter and leave more compliant, not soulless but less likely to speak poorly of Valaki Yanvich and Son's bookstore \u00b6 Nirin buys a journal, and wants to take a look at some of the books Nirin buys several books to hopefully get some insight into the history and culture of [[Barovia (Country)|Barovia]] Klepto arrives as he is leaving Fills Nirin in on what Kali and Sanar found [[Church of Saint Andral]] \u00b6 Nox and Ireena enter the church Nox prays to [[Kelemvor]] as he enters They meet [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] and introduce themselves Nox asks if it is ok to talk about Strahd von Zarovich here Nox reveals Ireena Kolyanovich#Strahd von Zarovich Strahd tries to woo Ireena [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks to speak to Nox alone - speaks to Nox about him being influenced by a God [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] tells Nox that [[Saint Andral]]'s bones protect the Church [[Church of Saint Andral]] is so hallowed that it is protected from Strahd and other evil But now the church is at risk, someone broke into the crypt and stole the bones of [[Saint Andral]], and thus church is no longer protected He believes [[Yeska]], altar boy, the only person to know, may have taken them [[Yeska]] says he told someone else about the bones, but would not say their name [[Yeska]] can be found in the graveyard or generally around the church Nox asks if the Morning Lord has ever come up with a way to restore life [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] says he has never heard of it When people pass they prey to let them pass to Mother Night Nox is curious about talking to someone who preys to Mother Night [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] states the Martikov's ([[Urwin Martikov]] and family) follow her [[Rictavio]]'s wagon \u00b6 Fortune involving the wagon - \"A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek.\" Kali wants to look inside, Nirin looks annoyed that they are committing another crime Plan Nirin disguises self to act as lookout Klepto creates a magic music box to distract everyone else around so that Kali and Sanar can sneak behind a shed to go invisible Kali and Sanar successfully go invisible and approach the wagon As we near it, something inside gets our scent and the whole wagon lurches Outside of the wagon is spattered with dried blood I bring you from Shadow into Light Decide to not open the wagon as we are worried about what is inside Speaking with [[Yeska]] \u00b6 Nox and Ireena ask him about the missing bones of [[Saint Andral]] [[Yeska]] is scared of Nox , but Nox tries to allay his fears Nox gives him his fidget spinner to stop him from crying [[Yeska]] confirms he told someone else about the bones Wanted them to think [[Yeska]] was cool [[Milivoj]] - the gravedigger, about 19 Hasn't seen him in a few days, lives at the orphanage, possibly a caretaker there as well Group reunites at the Church \u00b6 Nox introduces us to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] Sanar tells Nox about finding the wagon related to [[Fortune - Group - Knowledge of the Past]] and Nox fills the group in on the missing bones of [[Saint Andral]] Nirin decides to try and find [[Rictavio]] to find out if he will be around much longer [[Rictavio]] states he will be here for several days Looking for [[Milivoj]] at the [[Saint Andral Orphanage]] \u00b6 More active then the last time we were here as it is still the afternoon Klepto looks for Arabelle - no where in sight, Luvash likely has her on a tight leash Can't see anyone in the attic like we did last night Nirin , Sanar , Kali and Nox try to enter the [[Saint Andral Orphanage]] via talking to the headmistress Kali and Klepto keep watch of the front and back Knock on the front door and the [[Headmistress Claudia Belasco]] answers the door Ask to enter, assure her that the last case has been handled Nirin introduces us as the rest of his investigation team Nirin brings up the church and she begins to freak out with a panic attack Sanar detects her thoughts, they seem accurate to her panic Nirin asks to speak to the rest of her staff Cook has already gone home One caretaker died months ago [[Milivoj]] another caretaker, but can't really speak to him right now as he is sick Sanar convinces her, we have someone with us that can heal him we just want to speak with him She brings everyone through the house and Sanar reaches out to Kali to fill her in One girl playing dollhouse has splotchy bruises on her arm, another is holding her back Sanar detects her thoughts and she seems innocent to the causes, worried about [[Milivoj]] She brings us to the room of [[Milivoj]], he looks extremely sickly - boils, bile by the mouth Nirin is able to sense the aura of a fiend coming from around [[Milivoj]], although not exactly him Sanar is unable to detect any thoughts coming from him, digging deeper does nothing Nirin investigates his medical condition - magical in nature and not contagious Nox tries to heal him Nox casts spare the dying - nothing happens as he isn't at 0 hp Cure wounds - magic fizzles out around him Casts protection from good and evil - he seems to start to breathe more easily, but doesn't quite wake up Nirin uses creature sense again and the aura is suppressed, but still lingering Sanar asks if there was anything weird that started this Orphans have been waking up with bruises and night terrors There was additionally an accident recently - Orphan named [[Cedric]] died Fell out of the 2nd story window Sanar asks if they can search the orphanage for clues and if the rest of their team can join Klepto and Kali keeping watch \u00b6 While we were inside a bald-headed, well dressed man approached Klepto outside Asks if he is one of the new outsiders, introduces himself as [[Ernst Larnak]], wearing medallion of a fireplace hearth Extends invitation to meet his mistress - [[Miss Wachter]] - for dinner Asks for discretion as the meeting has to do with the Burgomaster While we were inside - Kali 's shadow moves when she does not It stands up and moves next to her eerily She tries to stab it, it responds \"why are you trying to stab me, I am your own shadow\" States it can help her Kali lights her lantern and the Shadow dissipates and reappears behind her Shadow tells Kali it knows her story, it's seen what she has and what drives her and what she has done in Luskan They didn't get justice because there wasn't any justice in Luskan Shadow likes the way she does justice - knife in the dark Shadow offers boon to Kali , one she already has, the knife she took from the Death House Kali asks who she should seek out - Lady Wachter, the baron, others who serve them and those unrelated Kali asks if Kira's soul is at rest, the one who didn't get justice Not yet, but together we can put those to rest that deserve retribution As the shadow fades back to Kali 's own, her dagger is left behind and covered in some oily dark blackness As she touches a plant w/ it it shimmers a bit Kali states she accepts the boon Investigating the [[Saint Andral Orphanage]] \u00b6 Sanar goes outside to try and get Nirin to come back inside Nirin says all of the children are going to die Sanar states we are all going to die, but its what we do in the meantime that matters If he stays outside and lets this happen then Sanar was right about him Everyone but Nirin regroups and decides to check the 2nd floor Nirin eventually decides to re-enter the house, but wants to talk to the [[Headmistress Claudia Belasco|Headmistress]] Nirin tells her that the girls need to be kept in the same room and be under constant observation As she leaves the room to gather the orphans, he looks to see what she was writing Chronicling the orphanage - page she was on details that one of the orphans parents were brutally murdered We start investigating the window in which [[Cedric]] fell out of Nirin discovers light fingernail scratches on the inside of the windowsill Indicates someone was holding onto dear life and was forced out - not an accident [[Headmistress Claudia Belasco|Headmistress]] states [[Cedric]] was 10 years old Heads into room he would've been in, only 1/5 beds in there look used, no other boys in orphanage seem of his age Klepto reaches up to open the hatch to the attic Nox looks inside, generally dark, a few random piles of clutter Also sees small child near a window silhouetted by the light Does not see any undead Child is busy carving a wooden doll with a stolen kitchen knife Introduces himself as [[Felix]], doesn't want to join the other orphans, they all seem insignificant As Nox steps closer he gets more and more aggressive Klepto heads down to [[Headmistress Claudia Belasco|Claudia]] to ask about [[Felix]] Confirms [[Felix]] has only lived at the orphanage for a few months His parents were murdered, and no one ever caught who did it She doesn't think [[Cedric]]'s death was an accident There was a locket on his body, a locket that wasn't here before and arrived w/ [[Felix]] Bad luck ever since he came here, [[Cedric]]'s death and 3 other boys his age have fled without return Nox tries to talk to him more as Klepto is gone As he asks Nox to leave his voice changes Light goes out, putrid shadow takes form out of boy and a demonic face appears Fighting the Shadowy Fiend \u00b6 Can kind of assume the locket was storing or holding this shadowy form and escaped to take hold of [[Felix]] As we fight the shadowy fiend it races around the house to take [[Felix]] back to the locket in order to posses another creature As it's last action before it is killed takes one of it's scimitars and nearly slices [[Felix]] in two Nox prays to [[Kelemvor]] to try and save [[Felix]] Succeeds in his prayer and [[Kelemvor]] brings [[Felix]] back to life Nox heals [[Felix]] back to life, but he awakes w/o having feeling in his legs Ireena, Kali and Sanar rush to [[Milivoj]] He looks much better, immediately pukes and asks for water As Nirin is taking care of [[Felix]] with Nox he sees an image of himself kneeling next to him Tells him that he saw all the same signs, and that he must follow all the clues He is Nirin and yet not Nirin , he is here to help He wants to know where he got the locket from, and then disappears Ireena tells [[Milivoj]] that we are going to ask a few questions Nirin asks about the missing bones - tries to act clueless [[Milivoj]] says he told someone about the bones He started getting sick and was falling behind on work He hired a few hunters and someone offered to pay for the location of the bones - thought he could use this money to help out the orphans He gave the information to Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker Sanar gives [[Headmistress Claudia Belasco]] 25g to make sure [[Felix]] is well taken care of and that she and none of the other orphans treat him differently Nirin asks Felix where he got the locket The baking lady gave it to him, said it was from a powerful adventurer When this happens the scales on his mechanical arm goes all the way down to devil Where did she give it to him/What did she say?

If a creature dies within the chapter, their body must be carried to the end of the chapter's events or it is lost to the pages of history.

Watchter fueled the mob, calling for the Baron's overthrowing. The mob overwhelmed the Baron's forces, escalating to violence. The Baron tried to run, but the mob easily caught up. They hung the Baron and threw the Baroness into the fire. Izek, meanwhile, was able to use the distraction to escape. Though Puff was able to track him all the way to the woods outside the city. The bonfire began to spread out of the ball, but Watchter was able to be convinced to shift the mob's chaos to the Reformation Center and the Baron's Mansion rather than destroying the city. The party rescued Nox, and was able to put out most of the fires. Together, we headed to the Reformation Center, cleared out the lower level jail cells, and retrieve Nox's stuff. We made our way back to the church and decided to follow up on the missing alcohol lead while the town settles a bit. There's a chance the Father would be interested in helping lead the town - if we can convince Watchter to play nice. We'll need to come back in a few days (hopefully with good news on the alcohol) to try and help the town recover. While traveling to the Wizard of Wines, Strahd's right hand man, Lord Rahadin, met us on the road. He officially invited us to dinner at the castle in 6 days. After some cold exchanges, he finally left implying it would be good for us to not miss this dinner. We ended on the road, tired but determined to connect with Davian Martikov Ryan \u00b6 Nox wakes up in his cell \u00b6 Hands bound, no weapons, armor still on Nox asks a guard where he is - reformation center, won't be released Nox wants to know what will happen to him - the guard doesn't know, but the Baron has a plan in the morning Nox tries to reach Corpse Star, or any other deity ([[Kelemvor]], Mother Night ), but there is no answer After some time Izek walks in, clearly injured but he has Nirin 's arm attached to his back He tells Nox he ripped Nirin 's arm off Nox wants to know how Izek is alive He only responds that Nox should talk as he killed Izek Nox says he was forced to, and Izek was mean and cruel to his goblins friends Eventually states he made a deal with someone to come to [[Barovia (Country)|Barovia]] alive Begins to haul Nox away and Nox tries to taunt him - Nox wants to just be killed instead of whatever is about to happen at the festival Nox bites [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] and is immediately hit w/ a baton by another guard Takes Nox to the festival, and tells him that he is a hostage/trap Chaos at the festival \u00b6 As the mob begins to take over, it is clear not everyone is on the Baron's side, even a few guards melt into the crowd and don't take up action against the mob [[Fiona Wachter]] immediately steps up to a raised area and begins to incite the mob further yelling how the Baron has failed and a new age of Vallaki has begun Someone falls and their lantern crashes into the oil beneath the wicker ball causing it to erupt in fire Con save - noxious fumes cause poison Teams first turn Sanar makes connection w/ Nox to let him know we are here and will get him out of there Nirin takes out his rapier, uses blood rune on Izek, additionally reaches out to Nox Klepto summons his turret, but isn't ready to take a shot until there is more chaos to disguise our attack Demetri activates Form of Dread, has Puff fly over to Nox to be ready to chew through Nox 's bindings Sanar casts Phantasmal Force Heightened to make Izek think that Nirin's arm and his great axe have turned into giant venomous snakes Nox unsuccessfully tries to break his bonds Izek immediately throws away his axe/ Nirin 's arm and flees The Mob rushes the Baron, ties a noose around his neck, and throws him over the railing of the platform snapping his neck They also grab his wife [[Lydia Petranova]] and throw her into the flaming wicker ball Some grab and kill a guard, others try to throw stones at Demetri as he is scary, but miss [[Fiona Wachter]] continues her speech saying the Outsiders have done this and they will continue to bring the healing light The fire on the wicker ball spreads further Fog additionally begins to raise from the ground and heavily obscures everyone's vision Teams 2nd turn Nirin tries to cut Nox free, but fails Sanar runs to pick up Nirin's arm and tries to place it on Nirin, but its backwards Ireena runs up, grabs Izek's axe, and cuts his feet free Puff tries to free Nox's arms but fails again Klepto uses a small mechanical buzzing creature to cast Sanctuary on Nox Additionally tries to see what [[Fiona Wachter]]'s plan is, it's getting out of control She states everything is in control, but has a crazed look on her face Klepto warns her that there may not be a Vallaki left if she doesn't chill out She hears him out and shifts her tone, tells the mob to protect Vallaki , but move towards the Baron's home/reformation center Demetri tries to fire eldritch blasts at Izek, but since he can't see he misses Nirin tries to tell the crowd to capture Izek, but they're too scared and refuse Mob continues to pick off guards as the flee after the Baron's death Fiona thanks Klepto for bringing this change to Vallaki, and moves towards the Reformation center The fire continues to spread and catches a building on fire Dex save - Additionally a wagon comes careening through the mob and we dive to avoid Teams 3rd turn Klepto uses his turret (force ballista) and thunderwave to put out a lot of the fire, including that which spread to the building Sanar is unable to see Izek anymore Puff tires to lift Nox to fly him out of the crowd, but he is way too heavy Nirin cuts the bindings around Nox's wrists Nox picks up Izek's battle-axe and finally notices Nirin's missing leg Sanar tires to determine where Izek is and uses Silent Image to make it look like a wall raises from the ground blocking his path Uses Subtle to ensure the mob doesn't know he did this Ireena uses a bandage to heal up Nox a bit Izek runs around the wall to another area of the town and is able to jump a fence to flee Crowd freaks out the wall suddenly appears, but quickly realizes it is an illusion Others in the crowd put out the fire or move towards the reformation center Teams 4th turn Klepto picks up a sword from the guard, and uses magical tinkering to make the sword glow (similar to [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s speech/fortune) Sanar loots [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s body finds signet ring of Vallakovich's crest and a set of 3 keys Surrounding area starts to calm down a bit as the mob moves elsewhere Demetri and Puff keep chasing Izek Izek continues to flee and tries to hide Mob continues to disperse Teams 5th turn Nox heals himself, takes a blue aura rather than red Sanar spots [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] and gestures that they're welcome to come chat with the group if they'd like Demetri continues to search for Izek, spots him turning down an alley Has Puff keep track of Izek Reuniting with Nox and Speaking with [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] \u00b6 Nox profusely apologizes for separating for the group He feels guilty for Nirin's lost leg, who is fine w/ it Nox tells Nirin he understands Strahd 's influence now that he is free of it We all make sure he is OK Sanar gestures again to the Martikovs - [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] heads over while [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] leaves with the kids Sanar and Klepto are worried about [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] making a move toward the new Burgomaster and are curious of [[Danica Martikov|Danica]]'s opinion Demetri is curious if Strahd will appear - [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] doesn't think he cares about [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] or Vallaki , only us She states if we truly want to help her, then figuring out the wine shipment would be the best bet It is one of the few things that give people hope Mob is on their own now, I don't think there is much anyone can do to stop/appease them Klepto isn't sure there is much us outsiders can do with the mob She believes the mob is probably converging on the reformation center and destroying it Klepto mentions it might be worth checking out the reformation center given the rumors Klepto heard in the bar ( Session 12#Bluewater Tavern ) [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] mentions the elves at the reformation center have been here for ages, prior to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s father at least Group agrees to head to the Manor/Reformation center, [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] joins Manor and Reformation center \u00b6 As we head there we see only about 10% of the city is destroyed Nirin asks [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] about a tinkerer's who could possibly make a mechanical leg, or at least the supplies Doesn't know anyone, but could definitely try to find some supplies As we arrive at the Burgomaster's manor we see it is consumed in flames Reformation center is partly on fire, with several dead bodies around it, the doors are knocked over Nox tries to run in on his own so no one else has to risk their lives Sanar tells him that there is more than just his stuff there that the group needs to find Nirin and Sanar convince the mob to let us in The pack is near the entrance and he looks for everything Immediately finds his box, hugs it, and the dons his weapon and shield Klepto doesn't see any bodies that resemble the Elves We work our way through main hall of the Reformation center See a few guards trying to hold off a mob of people throwing in Molotov cocktails Approach the door to the basement, it's locked but one of the keys Sanar has opens it We work our way down and approach another door, Klepto tries to hear on the other side but doesn't detect anything As soon as we cross over the plane of the door into a corridor noise completely ceases In the middle of the corridor is a pale blue glowing orb 8 heavy iron doors on sides of hallway, with another on the far end of the corridor Nox and Klepto go to open one of the doors Inside the door is a old, scraggly, almost feral man Nox gives him a ration - he immediately grabs it and shoves it in his mouth Nox lets the man leave, and he runs through the corridor and up the stairs Klepto tells Kali to stop the man from leaving Open each door, Nox repeats the previous actions Ask Kali to talk to Danica about who these people are as they leave - they were all villagers, some vagrants others not Demetri approaches final door at the hall, it is locked with heavy latches and bolts, with a 2 inch flap at the bottom to pass meals Nirin summons Aba to look through the crack and something immediately goes to grab Aba Demetri opens the latch, we see a hallway going each way and a foul stench of human waste immediately hits us Sanar uses detect thoughts but doesn't sense anything (intelligence less than 3) Group isn't sure what to do Sanar is worried they are too broken and could be dangerous to the rest of the village General consensus though is they don't deserve to die down here Klepto crosses the threshold and sees a pale Gollum-like, man in the open door across the threshold Silence is no longer active as he asks us 'whose there?' - Klepto tells him the Baron is dead and we want to free him Responds that he has stabbed several people and he'll stab more, clearly crazy Sanar is worried about letting them free and them escaping as they are clearly dangerous Klepto doesn't care, they don't deserve to die down here, we should rely on the Baron's opinion of them to guide what to do with them We should take them to the [[Church of Saint Andral]] Nirin uses Aba to try and try and distract the guy and slowly lead him up to Kali We open all of the doors and each room holds a similarly broken-minded individual inside, a few have corpses Nirin prays briefly over the corpses and Zrin-Hala appears Nirin finds a crawl-sized tunnel descending into the darkness in one of the rooms Nirin sends Aba down and it eventually leads him to outside the prison We all leave and encounter [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] when we're out She states some of the people we released were really bad people, others likely just caught [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s ire Taking the prisoners to the [[Church of Saint Andral]] \u00b6 Klepto asks if we can use his crypt to hold onto some of the more violent prisoners [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] isn't sure who is violent and who isn't, but they'll do their best to see who is who [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks if he thinks we could revert them back to their previous mental state Sanar says there was nothing left, but would refer to Nox 's expertise Nox is able to tell that they were subject to the feeblemind spell, but likely to be irreversible within their current powers Nox tells [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] that he is sorry about everything that has happened He says it isn't our fault, everything that has happened was already here, even if we were a bit of a catalyst Nox asks if he's heard from the Morning Lord at all, no one has for quite some time Demetri talks to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about the role of the new Burgomaster, or possibly a council of voices Isn't keen to take it, but if it's what the people think is best then he would step into a leadership role We speak to [[Danica Martikov|Danica]] about if it is worth leaving the town now to pursue the wine when there is a vacuum of power It's risky, but the people would appreciate the wine, and she can spread word of the idea of a council in the meantime Could possibly even offer [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] a seat at the council, as long as she doesn't have all of the power She warns us that we may hear rumors about [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] while we are there, but they aren't necessarily true A bit of a falling out between [[Davian Martikov]] (Urwin's brother) and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and they aren't on speaking terms right now Decide to leave to the Winery, sooner rather than later, so as not to waste time Heading to the Wizard of Wines Winery \u00b6 Guards at the Western gate have been hung Demetri is able to tell us that Izek fled the town to the West in the woods After about an hour of travel we come across a Black Carriage, the same one that was seen by some of the group at Kolyan 's funeral The group tells Sanar and Nirin who the carriage belongs to Sanar immediately gets serious, but knows it would be best to avoid them for now Lord Rahadin exits with a sword on his hip and an envelope in his hand States he has a friendly invitation from Strahd As he approaches us the screams enter all of our heads Sanar tells him to get out of our heads He apologizes for his 'disability' and agrees to back up so as to not disturb us Lord Rahadin states we are being invited due to our deeds and our ability to survive [[Barovia (Country)|Barovia]] thus far Nox is curious if Ireena would be allowed to leave As long as we obey all of the rules of Strahd 's invitation But, if Ireena finds her love while there then she will wish to stay on her own Sanar asks if this love will be free of magical interference? Rahadin says no, it is much more than that, we wouldn't understand Nirin opens the letter My friends, I have been quite impressed with your time in my land. It was a pleasure meeting you in Vallaki and sparring with you all, both verbally and physically. You are all unique individuals. I bid you dine at my castle so that we can meet in civilized surroundings and discuss various matters that were alluded to in our previous conversations. Your passage will be a secure one. I guarantee a safe journey and stay within Castle Ravenloft , so long as your party agrees to maintain chivalry and respect the sanctity of my home's artifacts and its inhabitants _Dinner is at 6:30 PM promptly on the 14th of this month. Please dress appropriately. I shall have a carriage to take you part of the way; it shall wait for you past the windmill on the Svalich Road. I await your arrival. Count Strahd von Zarovich - We talk to Nox about his experience with Izek and why he left Klepto and Sanar to go hunt [[Izek Strazni|Rozan]] - He didn't deserve to be brought back to life when others much more good people should be alive, not him - He's dangerous and we'll likely cross his path again - Nox still isn't used to others helping him - Ireena says that Nox helps others, we just want to help him back - Approach a bridge which crosses over Luna River, after which we come across a crossroads - Broken sign with directions lies in the grass off the road - Sanar and Klepto put the sign back together in order to figure out where to go - Follow sign southwest towards Krezk , the direction we were told the Winery was","title":"Session 15"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2015/#session-15","text":"","title":"Session 15"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2015/#raw-notes","text":"","title":"Raw Notes"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2015/#zach","text":"The Festival of the Blazing Sun went south REAL fast.
